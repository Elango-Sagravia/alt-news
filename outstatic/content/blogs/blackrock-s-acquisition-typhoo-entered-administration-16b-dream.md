![Typhoo tea faces bankruptcy amid declining UK tea consumption](/images/pe-backed-tea-brand-typhoo-faces-collapse-AyOT.webp)

UK tea brand Typhoo Tea, owned by Zetland Capital, is on the brink of[ collapse](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pe-backed-tea-brand-typhoo-faces-collapse) after entering bankruptcy administration. Supreme, a consumer goods company, is in advanced talks to acquire the brand. Typhoo’s financial struggles worsened last year, with pre-tax losses widening to £38 million and revenue dropping to £25.3 million. The collapse can be attributed to the [reduced](https://www.itv.com/news/2023-08-21/coffee-beats-tea-as-britains-favourite-beverage-research-suggests) tea consumption in the UK for several years. Experts claim that people started to prefer coffee over tea because it provides versatility.

**Amazon’s capital spending soars amid AI race**

![Amazon’s capital spending soars amid AI race](/images/amazon-I0MT.webp)

Amazon’s capital expenditure has surged dramatically in recent years, reflecting its aggressive strategy to dominate the AI landscape and cloud computing. From 2000 to 2020, Amazon spent a cumulative $70 billion on capital investments. However, in the last four years alone, this figure has exploded to $273 billion, nearly four times the previous two decades’ total. This spending is largely aimed at supporting Amazon Web Services (AWS), which generates two-thirds of the company’s operating profit despite contributing just 16% of its 2023 revenue.

The investment focus includes expanding data centers, developing custom chips, and funding strategic AI ventures, such as its recent $4 billion investment in Anthropic, an AI startup and competitor to OpenAI. Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, views these expenditures as a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to secure leadership in AI and cloud infrastructure. With capital investments expected to climb further in 2025, Amazon’s strategy underscores the growing financial stakes in the AI race.

### BRIEFS

**Private Equity**

**→ BOE warns of PE risks in insurance:** The Bank of England [raises](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/29/private-equity-tie-ups-with-insurers-create-risks-boe-says/) red flags about private equity’s increasing role in the insurance industry. PE-backed insurers often take on riskier investments, which could lead to asset “fire sales” during downturns, disrupting markets. The BOE highlights concerns about falling solvency ratios, which might trigger reinsurance contract terminations and liquidity stress.

**→ Indonesian tycoon’s $16B dream:** Indonesian tycoon Sugianto Kusuma is[ investing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-28/indonesian-tycoon-eyes-theme-park-f1-in-16-billion-project?embedded-checkout=true) $16 billion to transform North Jakarta’s Pantai Indah Kapuk Dua (PIK 2) into a tourism hotspot. Plans include a port, convention center, luxury hotels, and possibly a Formula 1 racetrack. Kusuma believes this project requires a huge investment and confirmed this will not be a short-term investment.

**→ GTCR invests $1.33B:** Private equity firm GTCR has[ invested](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/gtcr-makes-1-3bn-tricentis-investment/) $1.33 billion in Tricentis, a software testing leader, valuing the company at $4.5 billion. Known for its software quality assurance and used by over 60% of Fortune 500 companies, Tricentis is projected to generate $425 million in revenue this year with a Y-O-Y growth rate of 27%.

Early investments were made when bitcoin traded at $74, and now, with prices nearing $100,000, the fund’s returns exceed 132,000%. CEO Dan Morehead predicts Bitcoin could hit $740,000 by 2028, citing untapped financial markets.

**→ Hong Kong proposes tax breaks:** Hong Kong plans to[ exempt](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hong-kong-proposes-crypto-tax-breaks-to-attract-hedge-funds-and-wealthy-families/) hedge funds and private investors from taxes on crypto gains to attract asset managers. The proposal, part of a broader strategy to rival Singapore, also includes exemptions for private credit and carbon credits.

**Venture Capital**

**→ Sequoia eyes first deal in Asia-Pacific split:** Sequoia Capital is nearing a $30 million[ investment](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/29/sequoia-nears-first-asia-pacific-deal-since-regional-split/) in Vance, a Bengaluru-based startup specializing in cross-border payments. This marks Sequoia’s first Asia-Pacific deal since parting ways with its regional partners.

**→ DANNCE.AI secures $2.6M pre-seed funding:** Boston-based DANNCE.AI has[ raised](https://vcnewsdaily.com/dannce.ai/venture-capital-funding/thmqkrljpy) $2.6 million in pre-seed funding, led by LDV Capital with participation from Glasswing Ventures and Merck Digital Sciences Studio.

**Others**

**→ Australia tightens anti-money laundering rules:** Australia has[ expanded](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/11/28/australia-tightens-money-laundering-rules-for-real-estate-gems/) anti-money laundering regulations to include real estate agents, jewelers, and service providers. The new law targets high-risk areas like luxury property and precious stones, which have been exploited for illicit cash flows. This amendment, passed in parliament, aims to address money laundering activities that cause A$60.1 billion in harm annually.

**→ Japan’s chips and AI endeavors:** Japan is[ allocating](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2024/11/29/japan-earmarks-extra-99-billion-for-chips-and-ai-this-year/) ¥1.5 trillion ($9.9 billion) to strengthen its semiconductor and AI sectors. The funds will support next-gen chip development, AI research, and projects like Rapidus Corp.’s factory in Hokkaido. This move is part of a broader ¥10 trillion budget allocation pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.

### FOUNDATIONS

**How does the bond market impact the stock market?**

![Relationship between bond yields and stock market performance](/images/how-does-the-bond-market-impact-the-stock-market_-kyOD.webp)

The bond market and stock market are deeply interconnected, with movements in one often influencing the other. Bonds, being fixed-income securities, are generally seen as safer investments compared to stocks. When bond yields (interest rates on bonds) rise, they become more attractive to investors seeking lower risk, often pulling money out of stocks. This shift can lead to stock market declines.

Conversely, falling bond yields can benefit stocks. Lower yields reduce borrowing costs for companies and make equities more appealing by comparison. Central bank policies, such as interest rate changes, also play a major role in this dynamic. For instance, during periods of tightening monetary policy, higher bond yields can trigger stock market volatility as investors reassess growth expectations.

### WHAT IS

**Capital Expenditure**

Capital expenditure (CapEx) refers to the money a company spends to buy, upgrade, or maintain its physical assets, like buildings, machinery, or equipment. Think of it as an investment in things the company needs to operate or grow. For example, if a bakery buys a new oven, that’s a CapEx.
