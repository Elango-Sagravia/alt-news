### Swedish Real Estate Group SBB Takes Big Hit

Swedish real estate giant SBB[ plunged](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/04/landlord-sbb-falls-most-since-may-2023-on-local-papers-sell-tip/) 27% after Dagens Industri recommended selling due to debt concerns. Analyst Richard Brase highlighted SBB's shaky cash flow and the questionable impact of its recent divestments. The company's split into three portfolios, aimed at stabilizing finances, hasn't stopped shares from dropping, with survival doubts looming. CEO Leiv Synnes defended SBB, emphasizing that high debt is just "another risk." Yet, with a critical Q3 report due November 27, investor confidence remains shaky. SBB’s stock, currently hovering near record lows, faces an uncertain future.

### Hedge Funds Bet on Stronger Dollar

Hedge funds are[ doubling down](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-boost-bullish-dollar-bets-ahead-of-us-election/) on the U.S. dollar ahead of the tight presidential election, boosting safe-haven appeal. CFTC data shows $17.8 billion in dollar positions, signaling traders’ wariness of policy changes if Trump wins. A Trump victory might bring tariffs and strengthen the dollar short term, while a Harris administration could ease dollar demand by providing policy stability. Experts like Wells Fargo’s Aroop Chatterjee see a Trump win as supportive for the dollar, particularly if paired with strong U.S. economic data.

Xiao Zhang, co-founder of Chinese hedge fund Pinestone, faces U.S. charges for allegedly[ stealing trade secrets](https://www.hedgeweek.com/chinese-hedge-fund-co-founder-indicted-in-us-trade-secrets-case/) from former employer Arrowstreet Capital. According to U.S. prosecutors, Zhang accessed confidential research while in China via VPN, intending to use it for his own fund, now a leading Chinese quant firm. The U.S. lacks an extradition treaty with China, so Zhang, currently in Shanghai, won’t face immediate arrest. Despite these allegations, Pinestone continues to grow rapidly, with over $1.4 billion in assets under management. The case underscores increasing tensions over intellectual property.

### Emerging Markets Brace for U.S. Election

Emerging markets are feeling the heat as the U.S. election nears. The tight race between Trump and Harris has traders[ reassessing](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/03/election-anxiety-grips-emerging-markets-as-investors-slash-risk/) risks, especially in tariff-sensitive economies like Mexico and China. A Trump win could trigger tariff hikes, hurting exports and raising U.S. interest rates. Meanwhile, currencies in Brazil, Poland, and Mexico saw gains as Harris pulled ahead in some polls. Yet, with volatility high, hedge fund managers are cautious, balancing risks until election clarity emerges. Any sudden policy shift could see emerging markets swinging between gains and losses.

### Equiton Expands Real Estate Amid Rate Cuts

Equiton’s $1bn Apartment Fund is seizing rate-cut opportunities to[ expand](https://www.wealthprofessional.ca/investments/alternative-investments/equiton-targets-new-acquisitions-as-1bn-fund-expands-with-rate-cuts/387455#:~:text=Lang%20confirmed%20Equiton's%20active%20presence,units%20as%20of%20September%2030.) in Canada’s real estate market. Recent rate drops have sparked new property acquisitions, helping Equiton's multifamily portfolio grow. With rents below market rates, Equiton can increase cash flow while waiting for cap rate compression to lift property values. The company’s strategic use of fixed-rate mortgages provides stability and room for reinvestment. Senior VP Geoff Lang highlighted the strong fundamentals in Canadian real estate, predicting continued growth due to demographic shifts and limited housing supply.

### FCA Censures Odey for Obstructing Probe

The FCA has warned Crispin Odey, ex-hedge fund manager, for[ obstructing](https://www.hedgeweek.com/odey-deliberately-obstructed-disciplinary-investigation-says-fca/) its investigation into sexual harassment claims. The FCA accused Odey of “lacking integrity” in his response, suggesting he acted improperly to protect himself. Odey, who dismissed the allegations as a “witch hunt,” still faces potential regulatory action, which could include fines or professional restrictions. His hedge fund, Odey Asset Management, faced a downturn after these allegations, and the FCA’s warning further tarnishes his reputation. Odey can appeal the FCA’s findings, but this case spotlights ongoing scrutiny over misconduct in finance.

SK Hynix is[ speeding up](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2024/11/04/sk-hynix-speeds-up-release-of-new-ai-chips-at-nvidias-urging/) its next-gen AI chip release at Nvidia’s request, highlighting the demand for high-performance chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang requested early samples of SK Hynix’s HBM4 memory chips, essential for training AI models. The South Korean company now aims for a 2025 launch, intensifying its competition with Samsung. Nvidia, facing supply shortages, depends on SK Hynix’s chips to meet customer demand. SK Hynix plans to roll out its HBM5 series by 2030, signaling a long-term commitment to AI and semiconductor advancement amid fierce industry competition.

### Hedge Funds Use QIS Options to Limit Risk

Hedge funds are turning to Quantitative Investment Strategy (QIS) options to capture volatility premiums while managing downside risks. By packaging short-volatility trades in options, funds can limit losses to the premium paid, making it safer in volatile markets. BNP Paribas, Citi, and UBS lead in [offering](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-turn-to-short-volatility-qis-options-to-limit-risk-exposure/) these options, each with unique features. BNP Paribas adjusts exposure automatically, while Citi’s “timer options” hold steady through volatility. The strategy gained traction after August’s market turbulence, proving effective for risk control. This growing trend offers funds a safer way to benefit from market volatility.
