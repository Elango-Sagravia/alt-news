### Australia’s Future Fund Eyes Distressed Debt

Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, Future Fund, is diving into [distressed debt](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/09/04/australia-sovereign-wealth-fund-sees-13-billion-jump-in-assets/) investments. CEO Raphael Arndt noted opportunities, especially in real estate and private equity, driven by global credit trends and regulatory changes. The fund, with A$225 billion in assets, is leveraging these strategies to benefit from banks offloading riskier assets. While Future Fund has posted a solid 9.1% annual return, its focus remains on keeping exposure to equities and maintaining inflation hedges to navigate the ever-changing geopolitical and financial landscape.

### Multistrategy Hedge Funds Perform in August

Despite market turbulence, multistrategy hedge funds like Walleye Capital delivered [steady returns](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/04/multistrategy-hedge-funds-notch-steady-gains-despite-august-turmoil/) in August. Walleye’s $4.8 billion Opportunities Fund led the pack with a 3.4% gain, while others, like Point72, Citadel Wellington, and Millennium, posted gains of around 1%. The gains came despite volatility driven by concerns over a US recession and a rapid unwinding of the yen carry trade. This performance sets these funds apart from others that struggled, showing how varied strategies can weather tough conditions better than single-focused funds.

### Brazil’s Ace Capital Expands with Saires

Ace Capital, a Brazilian hedge fund, is [growing](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/04/brazil-hedge-fund-ace-capital-buys-quant-firm-saires-capital/) its quantitative capabilities by acquiring Saires Capital. This deal adds two quant-focused funds, Dinamico and Multicenarios, to Ace’s portfolio. Ace’s CEO, Ricardo Denadai, sees this acquisition as a way to catch up with global hedge fund leaders in technology-driven trading. Though quant strategies are still relatively small in Brazil, this move signals a growing interest in systematic, rules-based investing among local hedge funds.

### SEC Drops Push for Hedge Fund Fee Rule

The SEC has [halted](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/04/sec-ends-legal-push-to-revive-hedge-fund-fee-disclosure-rule/) its legal battle to reinstate private equity and hedge fund fee disclosure rules. After a court decision ruled that the SEC overstepped its authority, it chose not to appeal to the Supreme Court. The rules, adopted in 2023, required more detailed fee reporting but faced heavy industry opposition. The decision marks a win for industry groups and leaves investors with fewer transparency protections, though the SEC may revisit the issue through other regulatory avenues in the future.

### London Hedge Funds Close to New Investors

Kite Lake Capital Management and Astaris, two London-based hedge funds, are [closing](https://www.hedgeweek.com/london-hedge-funds-kite-lake-and-astaris-to-close-to-new-investors/) their doors to new investors. With Kite Lake managing $1.4 billion and Astaris managing $650 million, both funds are aiming to limit their asset sizes to maintain flexibility and maximize returns. This decision comes amid broader industry outflows, with billions being pulled from hedge funds since early 2022. Both Kite Lake and Astaris have delivered strong performance, but they now prefer to focus on managing their existing capital efficiently.

Hedge funds [significantly narrowed](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-narrow-global-equities-performance-gap-in-july/) the performance gap with global equities in July, coming within 0.17% of the MSCI World Index’s 1.78% gain. According to Preqin’s data, this marked the closest hedge funds have come to matching equity returns since 2019. Hedge funds benefitted from strong bond and small-cap equity markets, but the decline in commodity prices, especially metals, hurt some strategies. Overall, hedge fund assets under management continued to grow, reaching $4.7 trillion, despite ongoing net outflows across many strategies.

### BlueCrest Launches BlueX FX Trading Platform

BlueCrest Capital Management has [launched](https://www.hedgeweek.com/bluecrest-launches-fx-trading-platform-bluex/) a new foreign exchange trading platform, BlueX, marking its entry into the competitive FX market. Led by former LSEG executive Graham MacGregor, BlueX offers trading across FX cash, forwards, and precious metals. BlueCrest, known for its high-leverage strategies, aims to differentiate BlueX with advanced analytics and access to a wide range of liquidity providers.

### KKR Accelerates Fuji Soft Buyout Amid Bain Competition

KKR is [speeding](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/09/04/kkr-said-to-speed-up-tender-offer-for-fuji-soft-to-fend-off-bain/) up its ¥558.4 billion ($3.9 billion) buyout of Fuji Soft Inc. The company is aiming to finalize the deal before rival Bain Capital can submit a higher offer. Bain’s proposal, at ¥9,200 to ¥9,300 per share, surpasses KKR’s ¥8,800 offer, sparking hopes for a bidding war. However, KKR’s legally binding offer and early tender launch give it a strategic edge. Both private equity firms are circling Japan for deals, driven by favorable market conditions and regulatory changes that encourage mergers and acquisitions.
