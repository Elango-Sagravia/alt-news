### Hedge Fund Stock Picks Lag S&P 500

Hedge fund favorites [underperformed](https://www.hedgeweek.com/top-hedge-fund-stock-picks-trailed-sp500-in-q3/) the S&P 500 in Q3. While the top 20 most widely held stocks by hedge funds saw a 3.4% gain, the S&P 500 outpaced them with a 5.2% increase. Even tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft struggled, both falling nearly 9% in the quarter. However, some non-tech stocks like UnitedHealth Group and Berkshire Hathaway delivered double-digit returns, showing that hedge funds are diversifying beyond tech.

### Blackstone Targets $10 Billion for Asia Fund

![Blackstone Targets $10 Billion for Asia Fund](/images/4th-oct--blackstone-eyes-10b-in-asia--southwest-shares-jump-b-kwMD.webp)

Blackstone is eyeing a major expansion in Asia with plans to [raise](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/03/blackstone-seeks-more-than-10-billion-in-new-asia-buyout-fund/) over $10 billion for its third private equity fund in the region. The fund will focus on India and Japan, markets known for their growth potential and regulatory stability. Blackstone is already heavily invested in India, with $50 billion in private equity and real estate holdings. As geopolitical tensions in China rise, global asset managers are shifting attention to safer bets. With big competitors like EQT also raising massive funds, the race to dominate Asia’s private equity space is heating up.

### China’s Mining Giant is Redefining Copper Supply

Zijin Mining is shaking up the global copper market. What began as a gold mining venture in the 1980s has grown into a state-backed, yet entrepreneurial, $67 billion company. Zijin has [aggressively expanded](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/02/chinas-fast-growing-copper-champion-is-reshaping-global-metal-supply/), particularly in copper, tripling production in five years. With mines in Africa and the Balkans, the company is catching up with industry giants like BHP. But it’s not all smooth sailing — Zijin faces increasing resistance in Western markets, especially Canada.

### Private Equity Turns to Debt for Dividends

Private equity firms are finding creative ways to pay investors without selling assets. Belron International, for example, took on [€8 billion](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/10/03/buyout-firms-turn-to-debt-to-pay-out-investors-in-ma-drought/) in loans and bonds to hand out a record-breaking €4.3 billion to its backers. This strategy, called dividend recapitalization, has grown in popularity, especially as M&A slows. While it allows investors to cash in, it also puts companies at risk by piling on more debt. Debt investors seem willing to take the gamble, but too much leverage can push companies toward financial trouble, making this a risky approach for long-term growth.

Southwest Airlines stock got a nice boost after billionaire Rakesh Gangwal, co-founder of InterGlobe Aviation, [purchased](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/10/03/southwest-air-rises-after-billionaire-gangwal-buys-108-million-of-shares/) $107 million worth of shares. The company’s shares jumped by nearly 5% following the insider buy. Gangwal recently joined Southwest’s board after calls for leadership changes from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. His significant investment shows confidence in the company, despite recent turbulence with Elliott. This insider buying has provided a much-needed spark for investor sentiment, signaling that the airline might be poised for a turnaround.

### Australian Sovereign Wealth Fund Cuts Hedge Fund Exposure

Australia’s Future Fund [trimmed](https://www.hedgeweek.com/australian-swfs-man-group-mandate-down-by-1bn-in-h1/#:~:text=Australia's%20sovereign%20wealth%20fund%20the,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.) its allocation to hedge fund manager Man Group by $1 billion in the first half of 2024. Despite this reduction, Man Group remains the Future Fund’s largest external hedge fund manager, managing nearly $6.5 billion. The adjustment is part of the fund’s strategy to weather rising interest rates and geopolitical challenges. However, hedge fund investments continue to deliver solid returns, and the Future Fund has also boosted its allocation to Boston-based Wellington Management.

The hedge fund boom is expected to continue, with firms like Capricorn Fund Managers launching platforms to make it even easier for hedge funds to set up shop in Dubai.
