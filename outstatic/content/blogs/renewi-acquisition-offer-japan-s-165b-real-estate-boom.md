![Macquarie Asset Management's $887M bid for Renewi Plc aims to expand its European waste management presence](/images/macquarie-offers-to-buy-renewi-for--887-million-in-fresh-attempt--1--I4OD.jpg)

Macquarie Asset Management is back with a bold move to[ acquire](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/28/macquarie-said-to-pursue-fresh-takeover-of-waste-firm-renewi/) waste management firm, Renewi Plc after a failed bid last year. They offered $887M (£701 million), with a possible cash offer of 870 pence per share—a 57% premium on its recent stock price. With support from three major [shareholders](https://in.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/RENEWI-PLC-54321120/company-shareholders/) holding 15.1% of Renewi, Macquarie has until Dec. 26 to finalize the offer. Renewi, known for recycling services in the Netherlands and Belgium, saw its stock jump 47% after the news, the biggest surge since 2009. If successful, Macquarie aims to solidify its waste management footprint across Europe.

**Hedge funds unlock $165B in Japan’s real estate**

![Global hedge funds target Japan's undervalued real estate](/images/hedge-funds-pile-into-japan-s-165-billion-real-estate-trade-k3Mj.webp)

Global hedge funds are[ cashing in](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/27/real-estate-worth-165-billion-puts-japan-companies-in-spotlight/) on Japan’s undervalued real estate, which Goldman Sachs estimates to be worth an estimated ¥25 trillion ($165B). Companies like Tokyo Gas Co. are under the spotlight, with assets like Shinjuku Park Tower valued much higher than their book value. This trend is driving private equity deals and activist campaigns, as firms push companies to sell legacy assets. With property prices soaring, it’s no surprise private equity firms like KKR and Bain are [diving](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kkr-bain-brawl-worth-4-220000273.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADJmbcju9g0LxYI5Z0V6lTBcdpZiMx78OybhQMWYHlwaSUewZByZWbTrqShVa6uaiMr80Hw1BcK5DqNMSMs_7qQJWonNfWs5tzoMX75LfFZThx-iMbpmV6108EQReKYxj_795sAa316-om3d2x7IpZFL9V9k7uFaYAb5ICy9iBDG) into asset-heavy businesses. For investors, Japan’s corporate real estate is the latest goldmine waiting to be tapped.

### CHART

**Bitcoin’s movement with the S&P 500**

![](/images/bit-k4OD.webp)

Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its high beta, offering substantial gains when markets rally but magnifying losses during downturns, making it a volatile asset. Over the years, Bitcoin’s price movements have shown a strong correlation with the broader stock market, particularly the S&P 500. While its meteoric growth has captivated investors seeking outsized returns, this volatility undermines its potential as a safe-haven asset.

Unlike traditional safe assets like gold or Treasury bills, Bitcoin cannot simultaneously provide portfolio security and high returns. Its high beta signifies increased risk, which aligns with speculative growth but contradicts its promise as a store of value during market downturns. As Bitcoin gains more mainstream adoption, its volatility and lack of stability highlight the challenges of integrating cryptocurrencies into portfolios for risk mitigation or as an alternative to fiat currencies.

### BRIEFS

**Private Equity**

**→ Jeremy Coller hires CEO to manage a fortune:** Jeremy Coller, private equity pioneer and founder of Coller Capital, has[ appointed](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/28/uk-private-equity-founder-coller-taps-ceo-for-5-billion-fortune/) Sara Macedo as CEO of his family office, Coller Holdings. The move marks a strategic shift as Coller diversifies investments outside his firm’s $35B in assets. Known for championing alternative food investments like Beyond Meat, Coller’s fortune now focuses on growth sectors.

**→ Barings launches €380M private credit CLO:** Barings has[ unveiled](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/barings-launches-first-european-middle-market-private-credit-clo-at-e380m/) Europe’s first middle-market private credit collateralized loan obligation (CLO) worth €380M. This ground-breaking static deal, with a one-year non-call period, is backed by senior secured loans diversified across Europe. Barings’ Global CLO and Private Finance teams, boasting decades of expertise, collaborated on this deal. BNP Paribas served as the arranger, with Dechert providing legal advice. The launch comes as Barings continues to lead in global CLO issuances, pricing 12 new deals this year.

**Hedge Funds**

**→ Digital assets hit a record $3.13B inflows:** Digital assets just had their best week ever, with $3.13B[ flowing](https://www.hedgeweek.com/digital-assets-funds-see-record-weekly-inflows-of-31-13bn/) into investment products, pushing year-to-date inflows to a record $37B. Bitcoin led the charge with $3B in inflows, while Solana surprisingly outpaced Ethereum, attracting $16M versus Ethereum's $2.8M. The rally coincides with Bitcoin nearing $100,000, fueled by optimism after pro-crypto US tax [proposals](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-crypto-tax-proposal-game-205233545.html).

**→ Balyasny’s AI beats OpenAI in finance:** Balyasny Asset Management’s AI tools, BAMChatGPT and BAM Embeddings,[ outperform](https://www.hedgeweek.com/balyasnys-ai-outperforms-openai-in-financial-applications/#:~:text=In%20internal%20tests%20using%20the,to%20OpenAI's%20less%20than%2040%25.) OpenAI in finance-specific tasks. Using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), these tools excel at handling the intricate jargon of financial markets. Internal tests showed BAM Embeddings achieved 60% accuracy in retrieving relevant data, compared to OpenAI’s 40%. It’s important to note that Balyasny’s AI has been specifically designed for finance tasks and trained on financial models, whereas OpenAI serves a broader audience.

**→ Hedge funds to play a big role in the Trump era:** The hedge fund industry is[ poised](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-fund-industry-to-significantly-influence-trump-administration-says-agecroft/) for significant influence in the Trump administration, with Scott Bessent, former Soros Fund Management partner, named Treasury Secretary. High-profile hedge fund figures, including major Republican donors like Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, now have direct access to policymakers. David McCormick, ex-CEO of Bridgewater Associates, also joined the Senate, signaling a shift toward greater hedge fund involvement in shaping US policy. This increased influence could have wide-reaching effects on financial regulation and industry priorities, reflecting the growing integration of hedge fund leadership within political and economic decision-making circles.

**Venture Capital**

**→ HongShan struggles to deploy a $9B fund:** HongShan, a Chinese investment firm spun off from Sequoia, faces challenges[ deploying](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/hongshan-spun-out-of-sequoia-last-year-is-reportedly-struggling-to-invest-its-huge-war-chest/) its $9B fund. Limited opportunities in China have pushed the firm to expand into Europe and North Asia, including new offices in London and Tokyo. HongShan is targeting robotics, AI, and existing investments like ByteDance but struggles with slow capital deployment and frustrating limited partners. \
\
**→ Bitcoin venture capital firm Axiom hires ex-UK minister:** Steve Baker, the former UK Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, is[ approved](https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-minister-bitcoin-vc-axiom-advisory-role) to join Bitcoin-focused venture capital firm Axiom as a paid adviser. The UK's Advisory Committee on Business Appointments [(ACOBA)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/advisory-committee-on-business-appointments) cleared his appointment after a thorough background review, ensuring no conflicts of interest from his ministerial tenure. \

**Others**

**→ Billionaire Grifols family woes in focus as Brookfield exits:** Brookfield Asset Management has[ withdrawn](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/28/billionaire-grifols-familys-woes-in-focus-after-brookfield-exit/) its €6.45 billion bid to acquire Spanish healthcare company Grifols, leading to a nearly 13% drop in Grifols' share price. The decision was due to unresolved valuation issues and concerns over Grifols' financial transparency. Brookfield’s fallout happened following the [allegations](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/what-does-gotham-city-report-say-about-grifols-2024-01-09/) of financial manipulation by short-seller Gotham City Research earlier this year, which Grifols denies.

**→ Just Eat delists from the London Stock Exchange:** Just Eat Takeaway will[ delist](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/just-eat-latest-to-delist-from-the-london-stock-exchange) from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) to focus on its primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam. The decision, citing low trading volumes and high costs, reflects a broader trend of declining interest in the LSE. This move follows similar exits by major firms like Flutter and TUI. The shrinking LSE raises concerns about the UK’s ability to attract IPOs and maintain its status as a global financial hub. For Just Eat, delisting simplifies operations after significant losses, including a $650M sale of Grubhub earlier this year.

**→ Hong Kong proposes crypto tax breaks:** Hong Kong plans to[ exempt](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/hong-kong-follows-us-to-propose-tax-breaks-for-crypto-investments) private investors from crypto trading taxes to compete with Singapore as Asia’s crypto hub. This move follows US proposals to eliminate capital gains taxes on cryptocurrencies, boosting global sentiment. Bitcoin nears $100,000 amid optimism, while Hong Kong has seen a 40% surge in crypto VC funding this year. However, its $304M deal value still trails Singapore’s $746M. By launching Asia’s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, Hong Kong aims to solidify its position in the crypto market, attracting investors and fostering growth in the competitive landscape.

### FOUNDATION

**Why are bonds considered a safe-haven asset?**

**![Bonds provide steady returns and stability](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeqFkyLpPg9PlVYDFikA0l4s82wydTZpIa7lfaDJre_tO6LKy5tg6pEC6eDpDURGu1J9OvJACrREb35HzoRkfFbWC8HR1bjxi7n2YYnE2C_5-yzr9C__yBZwEgCVcWTjQoGSySBuA?key=yrowIl_QkmXxfGOf0C1JwVUf)**

Bonds are often considered a safe-haven asset because they provide steady, predictable returns and lower risk compared to equities. Government bonds, in particular, are seen as a reliable store of value, as they are backed by the creditworthiness of sovereign nations. For example, U.S. Treasury bonds are regarded as one of the safest investments globally due to the U.S. government's ability to meet its debt obligations.

During periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors typically flock to bonds to preserve capital. Bonds generally offer fixed interest payments, which provide income regardless of broader market conditions. Additionally, when stock markets decline, bond prices often rise as investors reallocate assets, creating an inverse correlation.

Central bank policies also boost bonds' safe-haven appeal. For instance, in times of recession, interest rate cuts often drive bond prices higher, enhancing returns for bondholders while offering stability during turbulent markets.

### FUN FRIDAYS

**Movie recommendations: The Banker**

![The Banker highlights racial barriers and financial ingenuity through a captivating story of ambition and resilience](/images/the-banker--1--YxNj.jpg)

On the surface, this inspiring film may seem like a standard drama about overcoming adversity. But at its core, The Banker is a sharp critique of systemic financial barriers in 1960s America. It follows two African American entrepreneurs, Bernard Garrett and Joe Morris, who use creativity and wit to navigate racial discrimination in the banking world. The duo secretly hires a white man to pose as the face of their real estate and banking empire, enabling them to build wealth and provide opportunities to marginalized communities.

Much more than a historical drama, The Banker is a celebration of financial ingenuity and ambition, offering valuable lessons on wealth creation and social impact. Watch The Banker for a thought-provoking yet entertaining finance film.
