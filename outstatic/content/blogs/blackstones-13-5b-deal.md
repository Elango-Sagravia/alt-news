### Hong Kong Property Struggles Worsen

New World Development Co., a major Hong Kong developer, is bracing for its first annual loss in 20 years, with a projected [deficit of up to HK$20 billion](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/09/02/hong-kong-property-pain-worsens-for-new-world-and-its-scion-ceo/). The company's troubles stem from higher interest rates, asset impairments, and falling property values, particularly in office and residential markets. This has spooked investors, causing a sharp drop in New World's share price. Despite efforts to improve its financial situation, including debt repayments and asset sales, the company still faces significant challenges in a struggling property market.

By the end of next year, landlords of commercial real estate in the US face [$1.5 trillion in maturing debt](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/08/31/landlords-face-a-15-trillion-commercial-real-estate-maturity-wall/). About 25% of this may be tough to refinance due to higher interest rates, which have lowered property values and squeezed rental income. Multifamily buildings are hit hardest, with many owners struggling to secure additional equity. However, optimism remains as lenders modify loans, and more credit is becoming available, which could prevent widespread distress. This scenario highlights the ongoing challenges and resilience within the commercial real estate market.

### Investcorp Co-CEO Steps Down Amid Shakeup

Investcorp, the Middle East's largest alternative asset manager, is undergoing a [major leadership reshuffle](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/09/02/investcorp-co-ceo-ben-gacem-set-to-leave-after-three-decades/). Hazem Ben-Gacem, the firm's co-CEO, is stepping down and leaving the company in November. Chairman Mohammed Alardhi will take on more responsibilities as the firm reorganizes its business into three units. Ben-Gacem played a key role in expanding Investcorp's presence in Asia and managing its $52 billion in assets. This shakeup marks a significant shift in the firm's leadership and strategic direction as it continues to grow globally.

### Hedge Funds Struggle to Recover Losses

Despite a strong performance in 2024, about a third of hedge funds haven't fully recovered from the [steep losses](https://www.hedgeweek.com/one-third-of-hedge-funds-yet-to-recover-from-2022-losses/) they suffered in 2022, especially those in the long-short equity and macro strategies. Funds like Tiger Global and Whale Rock have made gains but still lag behind their high-water marks.

### Ackman Revives Pershing Square IPO Plans

Bill Ackman is [reworking the IPO](https://www.hedgeweek.com/ackman-to-offer-enhanced-investor-incentives-in-bid-to-revive-pershing-square-ipo/#:~:text=This%20move%20comes%20after%20Ackman,shares%20in%20Pershing%20Square%20USA.) of his Pershing Square USA fund after withdrawing it last month due to weak demand. He's now offering incentives like warrants to attract early investors. This could make the IPO, originally aiming to raise $25 billion, more appealing. Ackman's new structure may resemble a SPAC, where investors get the chance to buy additional shares at a fixed price later. With the IPO expected to return to the market before year-end, Ackman is aiming to regain momentum and investor interest.

Hedge funds are maintaining a [bearish stance on banking](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-continue-betting-against-banking-insurance-and-property-sectors/), insurance, and property sectors, continuing to sell these stocks despite some market rebounds. Financial stocks were the most net-sold sector last week, marking the fourth consecutive week of this trend. Although the sector has seen some gains recently, particularly in Europe and the US, the overall sentiment remains cautious.

### Hedge Funds Shut Down Pods Amid Losses

Market volatility in early August led to several hedge funds, including Millennium Management and BlueCrest Capital, [shutting down trading pods](https://www.hedgeweek.com/bluecrest-and-millennium-closed-pods-amid-market-turmoil/) after losses. Traders specializing in Japanese bonds, industrial stocks, and energy stocks were among those affected. The closures highlight the strict risk management practices of hedge funds, where significant losses often lead to immediate action, even as markets stabilize.
