### Bridgewater Slashes China Exposure

Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, has significantly [reduced its holdings in Chinese stocks](https://www.hedgeweek.com/bridgewater-cuts-china-exposure-with-seventh-quarter-of-stock-bet-reductions/) for the seventh consecutive quarter. Over the past two years, the firm has cut its exposure by around 80%, according to its latest 13F filing. In Q2 2024, Bridgewater exited positions in companies like Weibo and Joyy while also trimming stakes in Li Auto and Yum China by up to 45%. This retreat reflects broader market concerns, with the MSCI China Index rising only 1.7% over the last seven quarters, significantly underperforming other global markets.

### Private Equity Firms Eye Grant Thornton

CVC Capital Partners and KKR are reportedly [interested in acquiring a stake](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/pe-majors-eye-grant-thornton-stake/) in Grant Thornton's UK arm. The sixth-largest accounting firm in Britain has been proactively approaching potential buyers, with a formal bidding process expected soon. Despite regulatory challenges requiring audit firms to be majority-owned by qualified accountants, the non-audit side of Grant Thornton could attract significant private equity investment. The firm saw its revenue rise by 7% last year to £654 million, and industry insiders suggest it could be valued at around £1.5 billion.

### Hedge Funds Flip Bullish on Yen

After years of bearish positions, hedge funds are now [betting on a stronger yen](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-bullish-on-yen-following-carry-trade-unwind/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20have%20flipped%20their,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.). This change comes as turbulence in forex markets led to the unwinding of the popular yen carry trade. Recent data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows that leveraged funds hold contracts valuing around $7 million tied to expectations of yen appreciation. Since early July, the yen has gained roughly 9% against the US dollar, driven by speculation around potential interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan. This marks a significant shift from the deeply negative sentiment seen just a month ago.

Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH, is [investing significantly in AI ](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/19/lvmh-ceo-bernard-arnaults-family-office-invests-in-ai-startups.html#:~:text=Luxury%20king%20Bernard%20Arnault%20is,family%20office%2C%20called%20Agla%C3%A9%20Ventures.)through his family office, Aglaé Ventures. In 2024 alone, Aglaé participated in funding rounds totaling over $300 million across five AI-related startups. One of the largest investments was in a French startup, formerly known as Holistic AI, which is working towards achieving general artificial intelligence. Arnault's tech-focused investments demonstrate his interest in innovation beyond luxury, with other investments this year including AI-powered digital marketing and human resource management platforms. Aglaé has made over 153 investments, with a strong focus on technology and business services.

### Ackman Adds Nike and Brookfield to Portfolio

Bill Ackman's Pershing Square has added [Nike and Brookfield Corporation ](https://moneycheck.com/bill-ackmans-pershing-square-adds-nike-and-brookfield-to-portfolio/#:~:text=Bill%20Ackman%27s%20hedge%20fund%20Pershing,million%20\(2%25%20of%20portfolio\))to its portfolio, marking its first new investments in over a year. The hedge fund acquired approximately 3 million shares of Nike and 6.8 million shares of Brookfield. This move signals Ackman's belief in the long-term potential of these companies despite recent challenges in their respective markets. Pershing Square reduced its stakes in Chipotle and Alphabet to fund these new positions. Ackman's concentrated investment strategy continues to deliver strong returns, with the fund generating annualized returns of 31% over the past five years.

### HarbourVest Raises $18.5 Billion for Secondaries

HarbourVest Partners has [raised a record $18.5 billion](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/harbourvest-raises-record-18-5bn-for-latest-secondaries-fundraising/#:~:text=HarbourVest%20Partners%20has%20raised%20a,to%20secondary%20co%2Dinvestment%20opportunities.) in its latest private equity secondaries fundraising. The firm's Dover Street XI fund secured $15.1 billion, with an additional $3.4 billion raised for Secondary Overflow Fund V. HarbourVest has invested over $55 billion in nearly 650 secondaries transactions, balancing both limited partner and general partner-led opportunities. This successful fundraising underscores the growing demand for secondary market liquidity solutions. With more than $127 billion in assets under management, HarbourVest continues to expand its global investment strategies across Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

### PE Firms Turn to Dividend Recaps

Amid a slowdown in deal activity, private equity firms increasingly rely on [dividend recapitalizations](https://www.investmentnews.com/alternatives/pe-firms-under-pressure-to-pay-investors-are-turning-to-risky-debt/256440#:~:text=The%20practice%20of%20loading%20up,watching%20the%20private%20equity%20space.&text=In%20a%20sign%20of%20mounting,return%20capital%20to%20their%20investors.) to return capital to investors. This strategy involves loading portfolio companies with high-risk debt, allowing PE firms to pay dividends without selling assets. In 2024, debt issued for dividend recaps reached $43 billion, a significant increase from the $7.4 billion seen in the same period last year. While this approach provides liquidity, it also raises concerns about the long-term financial health of the companies involved as they take on more debt to meet investor demands.

Goldman Sachs advises investors to [focus on high-quality assets](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/08/16/goldman-hedge-funds-head-says-stick-to-quality-as-risks-ease/) amid ongoing market volatility. According to Tony Pasquariello, Goldman's global head of hedge funds coverage, the speculative community has reduced its risk exposure since the July market highs. Pasquariello notes that corporate buybacks and strong macroeconomic data support a positive outlook for US stocks despite recent volatility. However, he warns that risks remain, particularly with low liquidity in August and uncertainty around the upcoming US presidential election. Goldman's strategy emphasizes staying invested in high-quality assets to navigate these challenges.

### Couche-Tard Bids for 7-Eleven Owner

Alimentation Couche-Tard has made a [proposal to acquire](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/business/7-11-7-i-couche-tard-circle-k.html) Seven & I Holdings, the owner of 7-Eleven, in what could be the largest foreign takeover of a Japanese company. The deal would create the world's largest convenience store operator, with approximately 100,000 stores globally. While the bid is still preliminary, it reflects Couche-Tard's ambition to expand its international presence. The offer comes amid pressure from activist investors for Seven & I to boost its value by focusing on its core convenience store business.

### PGIM Launches Private Credit Fund

PGIM is raising a [new private credit fund](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/08/19/pgim-is-raising-private-credit-fund-to-compete-with-big-players/) to compete with industry giants like Blackstone and Ares Management. The fund aims to provide large direct loans to companies, capitalizing on the growing trend of businesses bypassing public markets in favor of private credit.

The fund is expected to hold its first close by the end of the year, adding another layer to PGIM's existing private debt strategies.
