### HEADLINES

**Advent sells Manjushree to PAG for $1bn**

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcPsnWfSVYZ6vBOIVWtPDnO9uefqK8f5NdE_yKRiDu_ph8fYzb7pWsr8Pp7qcYrHIdwJLNIzF0miiNi2JhMcs_CmPVfzw_eKNMyEHBQ57Bipz8dIenVI2J_J2iCLJQGKX31L03xBA?key=o6yzrN1RlAu_hX39zPH5VGVO)**

Advent International has[ agreed](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/advent-agrees-sale-of-indian-packaging-firm-to-pag-for-nearly-1bn/) to sell Manjushree Technopack, India's largest rigid plastic packaging company, to PAG for nearly $1 billion. Acquired by Advent in 2018, Manjushree had been preparing for an IPO to raise $355.5 million but withdrew plans following the sale. With 23 manufacturing plants and over 50 patents, Manjushree is a key player in India's packaging sector. This marks a significant investment move for PAG, which has poured over $1.7 billion into India since 2019. Neither company has commented on the deal, but the acquisition underscores PAG's growing footprint in Asia.

**France bids €625m for Atos assets**

The French government has[ offered](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/atos-offered-up-to-625-million-for-assets-in-new-french-bid?embedded-checkout=true) up to €625 million to acquire Atos SE's AI and supercomputing assets, emphasizing their strategic importance. These units generated €570 million in 2023 and play a critical role in sectors like nuclear energy and defense. Atos is restructuring under creditor control after facing financial struggles, including a €2.9 billion debt swap. The French state previously made a higher bid, but it expired. Atos plans to sell additional assets, including mission-critical systems and cybersecurity, as it continues to streamline operations and recover from mounting debts.

### CHART

**Nvidia's fading outperformance**

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeBKIHbd-6qEv6SmulsTKaVkhxm9bRwojHWb3yPukgQmAgVtKtfxU8wfbrxF2kozrcpPTdS2kSZnuy1ktcCpbardWTnmZ3bRERqSiBX6TzOykZKRNZx9u5XQnW8yCbrsvi9ATZLxQ?key=o6yzrN1RlAu_hX39zPH5VGVO)

Nvidia’s ability to consistently surpass analysts’ revenue forecasts appears to be diminishing. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, its sales projections exceeded estimates by $3.8 billion, marking a period of extraordinary outperformance. However, this margin has steadily narrowed in subsequent quarters, with the latest difference barely reaching $400 million. This trend suggests that analysts are catching up to Nvidia’s financial reality, leaving less room for dramatic forecast surprises. While demand for its AI-focused products, including the Blackwell chips, remains strong, expectations of sustained hyper-growth have tempered.

### BRIEFS

Split into 3.5- and 7-year tranches, the bonds aim to refinance existing debt due in 2028. Vedanta, controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, paused the offering last week due to market volatility but resumed after seeing strong demand. Orders exceeded $1.19 billion, with pricing tightening 12.5 basis points. The company’s efforts to extend due dates and improve its financial structure have been rewarded, with its 2026 bonds gaining 77% this year.

The deal includes $2.05 billion upfront, with additional payments tied to coal prices and mine reopenings. This move is part of Anglo’s broader restructuring to focus on copper, iron ore, and crop nutrients. Peabody, recovering from past bankruptcy, will triple its metallurgical coal output. Anglo plans to divest platinum and nickel operations next while holding off on selling De Beers due to market conditions.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the "carry trade" in currency markets?**

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfnQVbeWG-c2zEE8IS5PNg1Znp8ib76p2CBMup58--fhuAoqHwKMV3v0Nwtz9zAN9Nybn1aoCN3YtUy4bpKANNMhWwhdLCZ1wg5QKBRzi3pFnggSPUWnn6fhi2pf2KrgZpoWnE7?key=o6yzrN1RlAu_hX39zPH5VGVO)**

The carry trade is a popular strategy in currency markets where investors borrow money in a currency with low interest rates and invest it in a currency offering higher interest rates. The goal is to profit from the interest rate differential, known as the "carry."

For example, an investor might borrow in Japanese yen, which typically has very low interest rates, and invest in the Australian dollar, which often offers higher yields. As long as the exchange rate remains stable or moves in favor of the higher-yielding currency, the investor earns a return from the interest rate spread.

However, the carry trade is not without risks. If the high-yielding currency depreciates significantly against the funding currency, losses can offset any interest income. The strategy is also vulnerable to sudden market shifts, as seen during global financial crises, when investors unwind carry trades en masse, causing sharp currency movements.

### WHAT IS

**Zero-Coupon Bond**\
A zero-coupon bond doesn’t pay regular interest like typical bonds. Instead, it’s sold at a discount and pays back its full face value when it matures. Imagine buying a $1,000 bond for $800 and receiving $1,000 when it’s due. The extra $200 is your “interest,” but you only get it at the end.
