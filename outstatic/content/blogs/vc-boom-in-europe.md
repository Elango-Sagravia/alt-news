## **European VC Market Shows Strong Growth**

The European venture capital market experienced a significant upswing in Q2 2024, marking a positive shift in investor sentiment. A total of €28.6 billion was invested across 5,066 funding rounds, reflecting a robust 24.4% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth and a 9.3% year-over-year (YoY) increase. 

This surge was primarily driven by larger funding rounds, with the United Kingdom leading the pack. Notably, Wayve, an autonomous driving startup, secured a massive $1.05 billion in its Series C round, underscoring the strength of the UK’s tech sector. 

Despite this encouraging growth in deal value and exit activity, venture capital fundraising remains a weak spot, with only €9.4 billion raised in the first half of the year.

Neustark, a Swiss startup focused on carbon removal, has successfully raised $69 million in a recent funding round led by Decarbonization Partners, a collaboration between BlackRock and Temasek. 

Neustark’s innovative technology transforms demolished concrete into a carbon sink, contributing significantly to carbon capture and storage efforts. The company has already implemented its solution at 19 sites, capturing and sequestering thousands of tons of CO2 annually. 

This latest investment is set to accelerate Neustark’s growth, enabling further deployment of its technology and expanding its impact. The funding marks a pivotal moment for the carbon removal industry, emphasizing the increasing importance of climate-tech solutions in the global investment landscape.

## **Hydrogen and Battery Storage Investments on the Rise**

The clean energy sector saw a mixed performance in the first quarter of 2024, with overall venture capital funding for clean energy projects dipping by 10% compared to the previous year. Solar energy, which has long been the frontrunner in clean energy investments, experienced a notable 21.4% decline in funding. 

However, this drop was offset by a surge in investments in hydrogen and battery storage technologies, which saw increases of 70% and 0.8%, respectively. This shift is largely attributed to the US government's recent $750 million support package aimed at boosting the hydrogen industry. 

Early-stage clean energy ventures are increasingly catching the eye of investors, particularly institutional ones such as pension funds, who are now more willing to allocate capital towards these emerging technologies despite the challenges posed by rising interest rates. The growing investment in hydrogen and battery storage signals a broader optimism in the sector’s potential to drive the energy transition forward.
