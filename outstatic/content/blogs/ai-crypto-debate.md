### Crypto's Role in AI’s Computing Crunch

The integration of crypto technology into AI infrastructure has sparked significant debate. Advocates argue that decentralized networks could lower costs, democratize access, and improve data integrity, countering major tech companies' monopolistic tendencies. Startups like Gensyn and Aethir are raising substantial funds to explore these possibilities. Critics, including Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures, express skepticism about the feasibility of such solutions, pointing out the immense resources required for AI and questioning whether crypto can meet these needs. Meanwhile, some investors believe in a complementary role for crypto and AI, emphasizing data security and privacy without replacing established cloud providers.

### Restructuring Trends in Distressed Debt

The landscape for distressed investing in 2024 remains steady despite economic uncertainties. A critical development is the shift from isolated efforts to a more collaborative approach in restructuring processes. The leveraged loan and bond markets have shown divergence, with credit spreads remaining tight for higher-rated issuers while lower-rated companies face significant challenges due to high interest rates. This has led to increased liability management exercises (LMEs), pushing the default rate for distressed exchanges to 4.02% by late July. The trend reflects a move towards greater cooperation among distressed asset managers, moving away from previous individualistic strategies.

### European Leveraged Loans Rebound After Decline

Europe’s secondary loan market has stabilized after experiencing its worst daily performance since October 2023. The sharp drop on August 5, driven by a broader equity sell-off, led to a 0.32% decline in the Morningstar European Leveraged Loan Index (ELLI). However, the market quickly rebounded with modest gains in subsequent days. The August decline was notable but remains minor compared to previous market shocks, such as those during the early COVID-19 lockdowns. The drop affected various consumer-linked credits, with significant losses observed in B-minus-rated companies like Wyndham Vacations.

### Strategic Buyers Drive Higher Premiums in PE Exits

Private equity (PE) firms increasingly opt for exits through strategic buyers, who are willing to pay higher premiums than other PE buyers. The median deal value for assets sold to strategic buyers surged by 70.8% to $480 million in the first half of 2024. Strategic buyers leverage their financial flexibility and lower capital costs to fund larger acquisitions, driving up prices for desirable assets. As a result, 57% of PE firms plan to pursue strategic sales in the coming year, a significant increase from previous years. This trend intensifies competition in the M&A market, with PE firms adopting more strategic approaches to bidding.

### New NAV Loan Rules Impact Limited Partners

The recent guidelines from the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) aim to enhance transparency regarding the use of net asset value (NAV) loans by fund managers. These loans, used to generate liquidity late in a fund’s life, have prompted concerns among limited partners (LPs) about their impact on returns. While the new guidelines are unlikely to alter existing Limited Partnership Agreements (LPAs), they will influence future agreements, encouraging clear terms on NAV loan usage. The guidelines address the need for explicit reporting and justification of NAV facilities, reflecting a shift towards greater clarity and communication between general partners (GPs) and LPs.

### European Cleantech Investment Nears Record Levels

Private equity investment in Europe’s cleantech sector is poised to set a new record, driven by several high-value deals. By early August 2024, the total value of cleantech transactions reached €15.9 billion, approaching the previous year's record of €19.2 billion. This surge is fueled by significant deals like Brookfield Asset Management and Temasek’s €3.5 billion acquisition of Neoen, and KKR’s €2.8 billion purchase of Encavis. The sector’s appeal is bolstered by its alignment with climate goals and the growing importance of ESG considerations despite broader economic challenges. The record-setting pace highlights the increasing focus on sustainable investments.
