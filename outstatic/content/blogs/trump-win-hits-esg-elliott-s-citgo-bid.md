### Mega-Cap Tech Shifts Systematic Investing

![Invesco survey shows investors shifting to factor tilting, sector rotation, and alternative assets to manage tech stock concentration risks](/images/faang-stocks-have-changed-systematic-investing--says-invesco--1--IxNj.webp)

Invesco’s latest survey[ reveals](https://www.investmentnews.com/equities/mega-cap-tech-stocks-have-changed-systematic-investing-says-invesco/258053#:~:text=EQUITIES-,Mega%2Dcap%20tech%20stocks%20have%20changed%20systematic%20investing%2C%20says%20Invesco,rise%20in%20alternative%20asset%20classes.) how mega-cap tech stocks are shaping systematic investing, prompting investors to shift strategies. Many are leaning towards factor tilting and sector rotation to balance portfolios against tech concentration risks. Interestingly, 52% of investors increased their allocation to value factors, aiming for diversification beyond tech-heavy portfolios. Additionally, there’s a rising trend in applying systematic strategies to alternative asset classes like real estate and commodities. With a higher demand for liquidity, some investors are now using liquid proxies and derivatives for rapid rebalancing, especially in less liquid assets like private markets.

### Elliott Denies RWE Buyback Demands

Elliott Investment Management has[ denied](https://www.hedgeweek.com/elliott-denies-making-rew-demands/#:~:text=Activist%20hedge%20fund%20firm%20Hedge,to%20a%20report%20by%20Reuters.) pressuring German utility RWE AG to initiate a share buyback program, following a report from Bloomberg. The hedge fund clarified that it hasn’t made demands or engaged with RWE’s management about buybacks. The rumors briefly lifted RWE’s shares, highlighting investor interest in a buyback. RWE has faced recurring calls from investors about potential buybacks, and Elliott is known for pushing high-profile companies for value-boosting moves. While Elliott did not confirm any plans, its reputation hints at potential future involvement in enhancing RWE’s shareholder value.

### Elliott’s Revised $5.3 Billion Citgo Offer

Elliott Investment Management has put forward a new[ $5.3 billion bid](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/07/elliott-floats-new-53-billion-citgo-bid-as-deal-faces-backlash/) for Citgo, aiming to address creditor concerns about its initial offer. Through its affiliate, Amber Energy, Elliott proposed to pay creditors directly rather than using a trust structure, hoping to ease objections. This alternate bid keeps its earlier offer on the table while removing controversial payment terms. Elliott’s move comes amid a prolonged legal dispute over PDV Holding, Citgo’s parent company, with Venezuela’s creditors eager to collect from the sale. The revised bid may allow Elliott to maintain its lead while satisfying creditor demands.

### Trump Win Sparks Renewed ESG Selloff

Following Trump’s election win, ESG-focused stocks saw sharp[ sell-offs](https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/104705/a-second-donald-trump-term-paves-a-road-for-sovereign-wealth-capital), especially in renewables. Hedge funds like Clean Energy Transition are seeing this as a buying opportunity, believing the market reaction is overdone. Analysts note that some Biden-era policies may stay intact due to their popularity in GOP-led states. Companies like First Solar and Tesla could benefit from steady clean energy needs, despite subsidy cuts. Long-term investors remain confident in the energy transition, but Trump’s support for fossil fuels signals a recalibration, not a rollback, of green investments as demand for oil and gas resurges.

### Trump Wins a Boost For Sovereign Wealth Funds

With Trump’s return, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) like Abu Dhabi’s ADIA and Singapore’s GIC may[ ramp up](https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/104705/a-second-donald-trump-term-paves-a-road-for-sovereign-wealth-capital) investments in U.S. stocks, real estate, and infrastructure. Trump’s policies, which are expected to include lower interest rates and pro-business measures, will create fertile ground for SWF growth. His support for fossil fuel production could ease energy prices, making the U.S. energy sector attractive. Some ESG-focused funds might see rebalancing, with investments shifting from renewables to sectors like natural gas and unlisted infrastructure. While the GOP’s influence is likely to stabilize, experts warn of potential tariffs, impacting Europe and China’s export-reliant economies.
