### Two Sigma Founders Step Down as CEOs

John Overdeck and David Siegel, the billionaire founders of Two Sigma Investments, are [stepping down](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/08/28/two-sigmas-feuding-founders-step-down-hand-reins-to-new-ceos/) from their day-to-day roles as co-CEOs. This move follows years of internal tension, which even led the firm to label their strained relationship as a material risk in a 2023 regulatory filing. The transition will see Chief Business Officer Carter Lyons and former Lazard General Counsel Scott Hoffman take over as co-CEOs on September 30. While stepping back from daily operations, Overdeck and Siegel will remain co-chairmen and continue to advise on strategy.

### Magellan Gears Up for $700M Fund Launch

Dubai-based Magellan Capital Holdings is about to launch a massive [$700 million multi-strategy hedge fund](https://www.alternativeswatch.com/2024/08/28/magellan-capital-launches-700-million-multi-strat-hedge-fund-dubai-uae-alts/). Set to debut next month, this will be one of the largest fund launches in the UAE. The seed capital comes from the family wealth of Hassan El Ali, and the fund will focus on equity and credit strategies. Magellan's move underscores Dubai's growing status as a hedge fund hub, with more global players setting up shop in the city. They plan to attract more external capital once their investment process is fully in place. Exciting times ahead for Magellan!

### Sound Point Settles SEC Charges

Sound Point Capital Management just [settled with the SEC](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/08/26/sound-point-to-pay-18-million-penalty-over-sec-allegations/) for $1.8 million. The company didn't have proper policies in place for handling sensitive info when trading collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). This was a big deal because it's essential for firms to avoid using non-public information unfairly in their trades. While there's no finding of insider trading, Sound Point has now beefed up its compliance controls. The SEC has been cracking down on these types of oversights, so it's a reminder for firms to stay sharp on their internal policies.

### Emerging Markets Hit by Stronger Dollar

![US dollar](/images/29th-aug--two-sigma-leadership-change--super-micro-troubles-a-UwMz.webp)

Emerging-market currencies are feeling the heat as the [dollar strengthens](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2024/08/28/strong-dollar-nvidia-suspense-keep-emerging-markets-in-check/#:~:text=\(Bloomberg\)%20%2D%2D%20Emerging%2Dmarket,results%20later%20in%20the%20day.). Latin American currencies, in particular, took a hit due to falling commodity prices and political tensions. The Mexican peso initially rallied but ended up paring its gains, while the Colombian peso saw the biggest drop, driven by declining oil prices. With the Fed's interest rate moves in focus, traders are bracing for more volatility. Even as rate cuts are anticipated, the stronger dollar could continue to pressure emerging markets, especially with global geopolitical uncertainties in play.

### EEX Expands Service to Nordic Markets

The European Energy Exchange (EEX) and the European Power Exchange (EPEX) are extending their future-to-spot trading service to the [Nordic region starting in October](https://www.hedgeweek.com/eex-and-epex-extend-future-to-spot-service-to-nordics/). This means traders in these markets can align their futures positions with Day-Ahead auctions more seamlessly. The new service is expected to cut down on operational risks and save money through fee allowances and cross-margining collateral savings. For those active in the Nordic power markets, this could be a big win. Plus, EEX is waiving fees for its Nordic power futures products until the end of 2024.

Griffin has been shifting operations from Chicago to Miami since 2022, and this project is set to become one of the tallest in the city. The new HQ at 1201 Brickell Bay Drive will be a serious statement piece in Miami's skyline.

![server hardware](/images/29th-aug--two-sigma-leadership-change--super-micro-troubles-b-AyMT.webp)

Super Micro, the server hardware giant, just hit a rough patch. The company [delayed its annual financial report](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/28/super-micro-shares-fall-23percent-on-filing-delay-hindenburg-research-report.html), raising red flags among investors. This comes after Hindenburg Research accused them of accounting manipulation and sanctions evasion. Super Micro's stock took a hit, losing nearly 20% of its value in a single day. It's a big fall for a company that was riding high on the AI boom and had just been added to the Fortune 500. With margins already under pressure, this latest trouble could make things even tougher for them.

### Xapo Bank Teams Up with Hilbert Group

Xapo Bank is [teaming up with Hilbert Group](https://crypto.news/xapo-bank-teams-up-with-trading-firm-hilbert-group-to-launch-200m-bitcoin-fund/) to launch a $200 million Bitcoin hedge fund. This new fund, expected to launch in September, aims to offer businesses and professional investors structured ways to grow their Bitcoin value. It's designed to provide opportunities that aren't typically available directly in the market. This partnership marks a significant move in the crypto space, especially with Xapo Bank being the first in the UK to offer interest-bearing Bitcoin accounts. Lower fees and a strong focus on growth make this fund one to watch in the coming year.
