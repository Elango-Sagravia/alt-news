![Hedge funds cut gold bets to a 14-week low post-Trump election](/images/hedge-funds-slash-bullish-wagers-on-gold-over-trump-election-win-I4MD.webp)

After Donald Trump’s election win, hedge funds[ reduced](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/15/hedge-funds-slash-bullish-wagers-on-gold-over-trump-election-win/) bullish gold bets to a 14-week low. With gold prices dropping 8% since late October, safe-haven demand has waned. Hedge funds held net-long positions stood at 197,362 tonnes as of November 12, marking a sharp shift in sentiment. Market volatility often triggers gold buying, but confidence in a stable political landscape has shifted investor focus, suppressing gold’s allure for now.

### CHART

![Global energy market trends and investments](/images/egergy-AyMj.webp)

The Asia Pacific region, led by China, is expected to contribute the most to this growth, reflecting the region's increasing energy demand and ongoing industrialization. Electricity use has been growing at twice the pace of overall energy demand over the past decade, signaling a shift away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy sources.

The forecast also shows significant contributions from other regions, including North America, Europe, and Eurasia, albeit at a slower pace compared to Asia Pacific. This trend underscores the global transition to electrification across industries and households, driven by advancements in renewable energy and declining costs.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why is the US dollar the world’s reserve currency?**

![Why is the U.S. dollar the world's reserve currency?](/images/why-is-the-u.s.-dollar-the-world-s-reserve-currency_-I4MD.webp)

The U.S. dollar is the world’s primary reserve currency due to historical, economic, and geopolitical factors. After World War II, the Bretton Woods Agreement established the dollar as the anchor for global finance, pegging it to gold and making it the most trusted currency.

Although the gold standard was eventually abandoned, the dollar retained its dominance as a stable, widely accepted medium for international trade. The size and strength of the U.S. economy, as well as its political stability, have bolstered global confidence in the dollar, making it the currency of choice for central banks to hold as reserves.

Furthermore, key commodities like oil are traded in dollars, reinforcing its global demand. This status allows the U.S. to borrow cheaply, but it also means that dollar fluctuations can significantly impact other economies, especially those with large dollar-denominated debts or who rely on dollar-based trade.

### WHAT IS

**Economic Moat**

An economic moat is a company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage over its rivals, protecting its long-term profitability and market share.

For example, a company with a strong brand, like Apple, benefits from customer loyalty, which makes it harder for competitors to lure those customers away. Other moats include cost advantages (like Walmart’s low prices), network effects (like Facebook’s large user base), and patents (like a pharmaceutical company’s exclusive rights to a drug). A strong economic moat helps a company stay profitable and resilient against competitors over time.
