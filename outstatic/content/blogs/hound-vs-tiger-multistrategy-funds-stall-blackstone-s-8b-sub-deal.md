### Tiger seed fund disputes profit-sharing deal

![Tiger Seed fund sues Robertson’s firm to end profit-sharing agreement](/images/-tiger-seed--fund-sues-robertson-s-firm-to-end-profit-sharing-AwOD.webp)

Hound Partners, a "Tiger seed" fund, is[ suing](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/19/tiger-seed-fund-sues-robertsons-firm-to-end-profit-sharing/) Tiger Management to end a profit-sharing deal that gave Julian Robertson’s firm a share of its earnings. Hound claims Tiger’s support in marketing and client referrals has dwindled in recent years despite Tiger earning over $150 million on its initial $23 million investment. Tiger counters, arguing the agreement is ironclad and transformative for Hound. The lawsuit comes as Tiger’s share, which now benefits Robertson's charitable foundation, increases after years of underperformance.

### Ken Griffin says hedge fund boom is over

![Ken Griffin discusses plateauing multistrategy hedge fund growth and optimism for U.S. business under Trump](/images/citadel-s-ken-griffin-says-multistrategy-hedge-fund-boom-is-over--1--Q1ND.webp)

Ken Griffin of Citadel believes the explosive growth of multistrategy hedge funds has[ plateaued](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-19/citadel-s-ken-griffin-says-multistrategy-hedge-fund-boom-is-over?embedded-checkout=true). Speaking in Oxford, Griffin noted asset flows into such funds have stagnated, with challenges like talent shortages and tighter leverage limits. Citadel, which has grown to manage $65 billion, regularly returns capital to investors, including $25 billion since 2017. Griffin attributes past growth to strong returns and proactive LP engagement. He also hinted at optimism for U.S. businesses under a potential Trump administration, citing revived risk-taking and investment.

### Blackstone eyes $8 billion Jersey Mike’s deal

Blackstone is reportedly nearing an $8 billion[ acquisition](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/blackstone-closing-in-on-8bn-deal-for-jersey-mikes-subs/) of Jersey Mike’s Subs, a U.S. sandwich chain with over 2,800 locations. This follows Blackstone’s strategy of investing in franchise businesses, including its recent purchase of Tropical Smoothie Cafe. Jersey Mike’s would add to the growing trend of private equity investments in food franchises, similar to Roark Capital’s Subway deal last year. The acquisition aligns with Blackstone’s history of scaling recognizable brands, leveraging their growth potential. If confirmed, the deal would mark another milestone in the franchise boom within private equity portfolios.

### CHART

**Palm oil futures are near two-year highs, raising concerns over food inflation**

![Palm oil industry trends and market analysis](/images/palm-oil--1--Y0OT.webp)

Palm oil futures are trading near two-year highs, reaching levels not seen since July 2022. Prices have surged over 20% this year, driven by supply constraints in Indonesia and Malaysia, which collectively account for over 80% of global production. Weak output in these regions, paired with robust demand, has raised concerns about rising food costs globally.

Palm oil is a key ingredient in a wide range of products, from food items like cookies and ice cream to personal care products and animal feed. This price rally aligns with broader increases in global food staples, potentially leading to higher grocery bills.

### BRIEFS

**Private Equity**

→ **Adani boosts construction with psp projects stake:** Adani Infra plans to[ acquire](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/20/adani-to-buy-psp-stake-to-boost-construction-arm/#:~:text=The%20Adani%20unit%20will%20pay,according%20to%20a%20separate%20filing.) a 30.07% stake in PSP Projects for $81 million, strengthening its engineering capabilities. The deal includes an open offer to minority shareholders, potentially increasing Adani’s holding to 43.07%. This move builds on Adani’s recent acquisition of ITD Cementation India, aligning with Prime Minister Modi’s push for infrastructure modernization. PSP Projects, with an order book of $65 billion, specializes in diverse construction, including Nestlé plants and diamond exchanges. Adani Infra’s joint control with PSP’s founders aims to enhance operational synergy while addressing India’s infrastructure needs.

With facilities in Navi Mumbai and Chennai, the project will deliver 250 MW capacity, addressing surging AI-driven demand. India’s data center market is booming, with expected $5.7 billion investments by 2026. RMZ is also restructuring into five business units, blending real estate and infrastructure ventures. Chairman Manoj Menda highlighted partnerships with global players like CPP Investments and Mitsui Fudosan to scale operations.

→ **India’s private equity slows but exits soar:** India’s private equity market is seeing[ slower](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pe-investment-in-india-loses-momentum#:~:text=PE%20deal%20momentum%20slows%20in%20India&text=This%20year%2C%20PitchBook%20recorded%20just,25%20recorded%20closes%20in%202022.) dealmaking, with $18 billion in investments year-to-date versus $30 billion in 2023. Domestic fundraising has also declined, with just $1.8 billion raised across five funds. Despite this, exits are a bright spot, reaching $39 billion—double the past two years combined—thanks to a strong IPO market. Notable deals include Brookfield’s $2.5 billion acquisition of ATC India and SAEL’s $1 billion renewable energy funding.

→ **Dubai Holding eyes dual real estate listings:** Dubai Holding, owned by Dubai’s ruler, plans to[ list](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/19/dubai-rulers-firm-said-to-eye-two-real-estate-listings-in-2025/) its commercial and residential real estate units separately in 2025. The residential portfolio, rebranded after acquiring Nakheel and Meydan, will debut as a REIT early next year, followed by the commercial unit. Advisors include Morgan Stanley, Citi, and HSBC. These listings aim to capitalize on Dubai’s property boom, with rising home values and office demand. The move also supports Dubai’s broader effort to deepen its capital markets, following recent IPOs of state-backed and private firms like Spinneys and Delivery Hero’s regional arm.\

→ **Digital asset inflows hit $33.5 billion record:** Digital asset funds broke[ records](https://www.hedgeweek.com/digital-assets-funds-ytd-inflows-break-33-5bn/) with $33.5 billion in inflows this year, driven by looser monetary policy and Republican wins.

Total assets under management hit $138 billion, with the U.S. leading inflows at $2.2 billion. Mixed sentiment saw Germany and Sweden post outflows, but the overall surge reflects growing investor interest in digital assets as markets stabilize post-volatility.

Backed by BHP and Khosla Ventures, Ceibo joins a growing list of firms developing sustainable mining solutions. Results are expected by mid-2025, potentially scaling the method to other Glencore sites.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What factors make a currency strong or weak on the global stage?**

![Currency strength depends on economic growth, political stability, interest rates, inflation, and global demand dynamics](/images/-tiger-seed--fund-sues-robertson-s-firm-to-end-profit-sharing-I4Nj.webp)

A currency's strength is influenced by a combination of economic, political, and market factors. Economic stability and growth are key; countries with strong, growing economies tend to have stronger currencies as they attract foreign investment, increasing demand. Higher interest rates can also make a currency more attractive to investors, as they offer better returns on deposits and investments. Political stability and sound fiscal policy further support a strong currency by enhancing investor confidence.

Conversely, high inflation, large deficits, and political instability can weaken a currency as they signal economic risk. Global demand for a currency, often tied to its role in international trade (like the U.S. dollar), also affects its strength. Central bank policies, trade balances, and speculation play additional roles in currency valuation, creating a complex interplay that determines whether a currency appreciates or depreciates on the global stage.

### WHAT IS

**Current Ratio**

The current ratio measures a company’s ability to pay its short-term debts using its short-term assets. It’s calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. If a company has a current ratio of 2, it means it has twice as many assets as liabilities, showing it’s financially stable in the short term.
