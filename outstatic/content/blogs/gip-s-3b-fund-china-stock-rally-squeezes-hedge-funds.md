### Argonaut Questions Fed Cuts Boosting Green Bets

Barry Norris, from Argonaut Capital Partners, [believes](https://www.hedgeweek.com/argonaut-betting-against-fed-cuts-reviving-green-bets/) expecting Fed cuts to revive green stocks is misguided. Despite declining rates, he argues that insiders still seek government subsidies, signaling structural issues. Wall Street, however, remains optimistic, with Ørsted and Siemens Energy soaring this year. But not all green stocks are shining, with Vestas down 30% due to maintenance costs and competition. The S&P Global Clean Energy Index, down 6% this year, underperforms the S&P 500's 20% rise, leaving room for skepticism around the energy transition’s sustainability.

### Hedge Funds Boost Bullish Bets on Gold

Hedge funds and large investors have ramped up [bullish](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-up-bullish-gold-bets-to-four-year-high/#:~:text=Bullish%20bets%20on%20gold%20by,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.) gold bets to a four-year high. This comes as the Fed’s recent rate cuts have driven optimism for more to follow. Net-long positions on gold increased to 254,841 contracts, the highest since March 2020, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Gold prices hit a record $2,685.58 per ounce last week, continuing to climb. As inflation worries linger, gold remains a popular safe haven for investors looking to hedge against economic uncertainties and volatile financial markets.

Financial advisors have [sold](https://www.investmentnews.com/alternatives/sales-of-alternative-investments-climbing-in-2024/257435#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFundraising%20in%20alternative%20investments%20through,chairman%20of%20Robert%20A.%20Stanger.) $76.6 billion worth of illiquid alternative investments through August, matching 2023’s full-year total. Nontraded REITs are having a tough year, raising just $4.2 billion, down from a $33 billion high in 2022. However, nontraded business development companies (BDCs) are becoming the favored alternative, raising $23.7 billion so far this year. BDCs offer attractive yields, lending to small and mid-sized private companies. Investors are flocking to alternatives for higher returns amid a shifting economic landscape.

### Glenview Pushes for CVS Operational Overhaul

Glenview Capital Management, with a $700m [stake](https://www.hedgeweek.com/glenview-wants-operational-improvements-at-cvs-health/) in CVS Health, is pushing for operational improvements. CVS has struggled this year, lowering its profit forecast four times and unveiling a cost-saving plan targeting $2bn through AI and automation. Speculation is growing that CVS may attract further activist attention, with firms like Sachem Head Capital Management also acquiring shares. Glenview’s involvement signals growing pressure for CVS to enhance shareholder value, as it faces a challenging environment in the healthcare sector.

![Ridgeview Partners Buys PayRange](/images/1st-oct--gips-3b-fund--china-stock-rally-squeezes-hedge-funds-b--1--g2Mj.webp)

Ridgeview Partners, a newly formed private equity firm, [acquired](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/30/private-equity-firm-ridgeview-buys-payrange-in-first-deal/) a majority stake in PayRange, a mobile payment startup backed by Jared Leto. This marks Ridgeview’s first deal, partnering with Baupost Group for the acquisition. Terms weren’t disclosed, but Ridgeview aims to target companies worth $200 million to $1 billion. PayRange, led by founder Paresh Patel, provides payment technology for laundromats and vending machines with over 8,000 customers. Bain Capital will finance the deal, signaling a strong start for Ridgeview as it prepares for its first fundraising round in 2025.

### Quant Hedge Funds Hit by China Stock Surge

China's biggest stock rally in over a decade has placed quant hedge funds under [margin call](https://www.hedgeweek.com/quant-hedge-funds-caught-in-short-squeeze-following-china-share-surge-and-trading-glitch/) pressure. Friday's surge, combined with a Shanghai Stock Exchange glitch, left many quants unable to cover losses on short positions. Some brokerages extended deadlines, but funds relying on market-neutral strategies were caught off-guard. This comes as quants struggle to recover from February's market meltdown. While the rally continues, stress tests over the weekend aim to prevent further chaos. The quants' ability to recover remains uncertain as China’s market dynamics shift dramatically.

### GIP Aims for $3B Infrastructure Debt Fund

Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) is [raising](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/30/gip-targets-3-billion-for-new-infrastructure-debt-fund/) $3 billion for a new infrastructure debt fund, its third in this strategy. This fund focuses on riskier assets offering higher returns, following the success of GIP’s previous $1.4 billion fund. With infrastructure investments spanning energy, power, renewables, and transport in OECD countries, GIP continues to attract interest. BlackRock’s recent acquisition of GIP for $12.5 billion is set to close, marking a significant moment in the infrastructure investment space. This new fund positions GIP to tap into growing demand for higher-risk, high-return infrastructure investments.

### Quant Hedge Funds Face More Margin Calls

China's stock rally [continues](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/09/30/quant-hedge-funds-face-more-margin-calls-as-chinese-stocks-surge/) to strain quant hedge funds. Firms shorting index futures as part of market-neutral strategies faced new margin calls after shares surged on Monday. While Friday’s technical glitch worsened losses, funds remain under pressure. Some managed to meet margin requirements, but the broader squeeze persists. The CSI 300 index's 13% gain contrasts with losses in quants' hedged positions. As market dynamics shift rapidly, quants remain caught between rallying stocks and their short futures, underscoring the challenges of navigating China’s volatile markets.

### Elliott Affiliate’s $7.3bn Citgo Bid Wins Auction

Amber Energy, an Elliott affiliate, made a leading [$ 7.3 billion](https://www.hedgeweek.com/elliott-affiliates-7-3bn-bid-wins-citgo-auction/) bid for Citgo’s US parent, PDV Holding, to resolve Venezuela's $20bn debt. Pending court approval, other bidders have 45 days to counter the offer. Citgo, once Venezuela’s prized foreign asset, has faced complex legal challenges under US sanctions. Amber Energy’s victory still leaves many creditors short of full repayment. With political and regulatory hurdles remaining, this high-stakes deal showcases Elliott's ongoing influence and strategy within the global energy space.
