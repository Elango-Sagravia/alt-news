![AI-Powered Hedge Fund Analysis Platform](/images/ai-hedge-fund-platform-launch--abrdn-shuts-fund--regal-targets-1b-1-MwOT.webp)

Hedge fund index expert HFR and Radient AI have [teamed up](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hfr-and-radient-launch-ai-driven-hedge-fund-analysis-platform/) to launch a new AI-driven hedge fund analysis platform. This system combines HFR's vast hedge fund datasets with Radient AI's intelligence tools, giving users a deeper dive into hedge fund performance. It allows users to easily track investments, measure hedge funds against mutual funds and ETFs, and streamline research. It’s an exciting leap for investors looking to manage multi-fund portfolios across global markets more efficiently. Think of it as an AI-powered research assistant for hedge funds.

### abrdn Closes Hedge Fund After Poor Returns

abrdn has [decided](https://www.hedgeweek.com/abrdn-shuts-struggling-hedge-fund-amid-poor-performance/#:~:text=abrdn%20has%20closed%20its%20Global,report%20by%20the%20Financial%20Standard.) to shut down its Global Risk Mitigation Fund due to consistently poor performance. The fund, launched in 2021, aimed to provide positive returns during market volatility but instead delivered an annualized loss of 10.5%. By August 2024, the fund was managing just $2.65 million in assets. abrdn cited the small fund size and shrinking investor interest as the main reasons for this closure. Sometimes, even experienced managers can’t avoid a misstep, and abrdn decide it is time to pull the plug.

### Regal Partners Aims for $1B Hedge Fund

Regal Partners, born from the merger of Regal Funds Management and VGI Partners, is [targeting](https://www.hedgeweek.com/regal-partners-eyes-1bn-for-new-cayman-islands-fund/) $1 billion for a new Cayman Islands-based hedge fund. This fund will act as a feeder to Regal’s successful multi-strategy fund, which covers private credit, water, power, and resources. With a 19% return since December, Regal is riding high, and this fund expansion is aimed at institutional investors looking for tax-efficient investment opportunities. Regal’s growth is incredible, with assets rising from AUD4.7 billion to nearly AUD17 billion in just two years.

### New Hedge Fund Bets on Japan’s Market Revival

Sengu Capital is launching a [new](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/08/new-hedge-fund-gains-backing-for-bets-on-japan-market-revival/) hedge fund focusing on Japan’s market, aiming to improve corporate governance. The fund will start trading in October, backed by HS Group. With Japan emerging from deflation and China’s economy slowing, Japan-focused investments are seeing renewed interest. Sengu plans to pick companies with improved management and corporate governance for long positions while betting against those with declining fundamentals. It’s a unique approach in Japan’s hedge fund scene, targeting generational changes and better corporate strategies. Sengu hopes to match previous double-digit returns over the next few years.

### Hedge Funds Reduce Oil Bets Amid Supply Worries

Hedge funds are becoming less [bullish](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/06/hedge-funds-slash-bets-on-an-oil-rally-to-lowest-ever-amid-rout/) on oil, slashing their bets to the lowest levels in 13 years. Concerns about increased supply from Libya, potential output boosts from OPEC+, and lower demand in the US and China have caused a plunge in oil prices. Hedge funds cut their combined positions on Brent and WTI oil futures, according to recent data. Despite a pause on OPEC+ production increases, prices haven’t rebounded, keeping the oil market under pressure. This signals a cautious outlook from hedge funds on a potential oil rally.

### Ex-Point72 President Scraps Hedge Fund Plans

Douglas Haynes, former president of Point72 Asset Management, has [abandoned](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/06/ex-point72-president-haynes-abandons-plan-to-start-hedge-fund/) plans to launch his hedge fund, Norias Research Group. Despite assembling a 30-person team and building out infrastructure, Norias couldn’t raise enough initial capital to get off the ground. This highlights the challenge of starting a hedge fund in today’s environment, where investors tend to favor larger, more established players. Since 2019, over 3,100 hedge funds have closed, outpacing new launches. Haynes’ decision is another reminder that raising capital for a hedge fund isn’t as easy as it seems.

### New Index Rules Impact $350 Billion Funds

Funds [managing](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/06/funds-with-350-billion-are-exposed-to-sps-new-index-cap-rules/) $350 billion are preparing for a significant reshuffle later this month, as S&P Dow Jones Indices introduces new rules. The changes aim to reduce the dominance of large-cap tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia. Instead of the smallest top stocks being capped first, the largest companies will see their weightings trimmed. This is a big shift for index-tracking funds and will likely impact major ETFs like XLK. The new rules are designed to reduce concentration risk and avoid huge tracking errors, making portfolio management more balanced.
