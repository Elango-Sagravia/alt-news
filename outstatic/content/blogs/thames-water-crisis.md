### JPMorgan Leads Bank Capital Reduction Moves

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is leading the charge to reduce its preferred shares, planning to [repay](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/09/10/jpmorgan-leads-wall-streets-capital-pivot-ahead-of-basel-endgame-rules/) a $1.6 billion issue next month. This move comes as banks reposition their capital strategies in anticipation of relaxed Basel Endgame rules. The new rules, set for mid-2025, are less demanding than originally proposed. Banks, including Bank of America and Citigroup, are trimming preferred stock as part of these adjustments, creating favorable conditions for investors with strong returns from shrinking supply.

Brookfield Asset Management says the real estate market is bouncing back after two years of stagnation. During their investor day in New York, executives pointed to easing inflation, lower interest rates, and renewed access to debt markets as signs of recovery. With limited new construction and a backlog of maturing debt, the company expects office markets to [rebound](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/10/brookfields-hyler-sees-thaw-in-real-estate-after-two-year-slump/) significantly over the next couple of years, especially as supply remains tight.

### Elliott Management Buys Thames Water Debt

Elliott Management, known for its aggressive tactics, has [bought](https://www.hedgeweek.com/us-hedge-funds-wade-into-thames-water-debt-crisis/#:~:text=Elliott%20Management%2C%20the%20New%20York,report%20by%20the%20Daily%20Telegraph.) a large portion of Thames Water's debt at discounted prices. As the UK's largest water supplier struggles financially, Elliott has become one of the key lenders, joining a committee tasked with restructuring the company's debt. Other major hedge funds, like Apollo and DE Shaw, are also involved. The restructuring aims to prevent nationalization, though creditors may face losses of up to 20%. Junior creditors could see even steeper losses, with some potentially wiped out.

### Multi-Manager Hedge Funds See First Outflows in Seven Years

After years of consistent growth, multi-manager hedge funds are seeing outflows for the first time in seven years, according to a [report](https://www.hedgeweek.com/multi-manager-hedge-funds-see-outflows-as-investor-interest-wanes-says-goldman/) by Goldman Sachs. Over $30 billion in client withdrawals have occurred, driven by high fees, lackluster returns, and a slowdown in new investor interest. While industry giants like Citadel and Millennium continue to perform well, smaller funds have struggled to keep pace. Despite the outflows, multi-manager hedge funds remain a major part of the hedge fund world, still attracting new talent and continuing operations.

Concerns over [weakening](https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/opec-vs-iea-diverging-oil-demand-forecasts-signal-an-uncertain-future-124091001319_1.html) demand from major economies like the US and China, combined with growing supply from OPEC+ countries, have weighed on oil prices. Hedge funds have reduced their net-long positions by nearly 100,000 lots. Talks of a potential deal to restore Libya's oil production have further pressured the market. The future for oil prices remains uncertain, with algorithmic funds also contributing to the recent slump.
