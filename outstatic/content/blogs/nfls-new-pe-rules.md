### Zambia's Plan to Boost Mineral Ownership

Zambia is stepping up its game in the critical minerals sector by planning a state-owned firm to hold at least [30% of new mines](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-29/zambia-plans-state-firm-to-own-30-of-critical-minerals-mines?srnd=phx-alternative-investments).

### Buy Now, Pay Later for Private Funds

In the private fund world, sellers are now letting buyers defer payments by up to 18 months instead of taking steep discounts. This ["buy now, pay later"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-29/buy-now-pay-later-beats-steep-discounts-for-private-fund-sellers?srnd=phx-alternative-investments) approach is gaining traction as high interest rates make private equity and credit funds less appealing. Deferred payments help sellers get better deals, keeping market activity up despite liquidity challenges. It's a growing trend, with 63% of secondary-market participants using deferrals in 2023. While it adds complexity, it's a handy tool to avoid big price cuts in a sluggish M&A environment.

Teams like the Los Angeles Chargers and Buffalo Bills are already seeking new investors under this new policy.

### Cat Bond Returns Take a Hit

Fermat Capital Management saw its [returns drop by 50%](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/nfl-opens-doors-to-private-equity-ownership/) in the first half of 2024.

Despite the dip, investors have mostly avoided big losses so far, as recent hurricanes haven't triggered significant payouts. Cat bonds, though risky, have been top performers in the hedge fund world, but this year, they're facing tough challenges.
