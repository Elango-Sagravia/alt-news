Retailers are facing a scary Halloween as consumer spending is expected to[ drop](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/10/12/troubled-retailers-face-a-halloween-crunch-with-consumers-spending-less/) by 5% this year, falling to $11.6 billion.

Horizon Robotics is gearing up for a major IPO in Hong Kong, aiming to[ raise $800 million](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2024/10/14/horizon-robotics-said-to-draw-alibaba-baidu-as-investors-in-ipo/) with backing from big names like Alibaba and Baidu. Known for its autonomous driving systems, Horizon plans to use the funds to fuel its expansion in AI and autonomous technology. Despite reporting a significant loss of $721 million in the first half of 2024, the company’s growing revenue and strategic partnerships, including a joint venture with Volkswagen, make it one of the year’s most anticipated IPOs. Investors are watching closely as it taps into China’s booming AI sector.

### MBK Seeks Control of Korea Zinc Amid Feud

MBK Partners is making a power move to take control of Korea Zinc by securing a[ 5.34% stake](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/10/13/deadline-looms-in-bitter-feud-for-control-of-korea-metals-empire/), intensifying a family feud within the company. The private equity firm teamed up with Young Poong Corp. in a bid to gain 38.47% control. Korea Zinc, a key player in energy-transition metals, is battling internal conflict over its future direction, especially as Chairman Choi Yun-Beom pushes for green transition investments. With buyout bids and retaliatory offers driving up stock prices, this corporate showdown has broader implications for the global zinc market.

### Semirara Mining Plans $5B Coal Expansion

Semirara Mining, the Philippines’ largest coal producer, is looking to spend over[ $5 billion](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/14/philippines-top-coal-producer-plans-5-billion-mine-expansion/) on expanding its mining operations. Despite global pressure to phase out coal, the Philippines continues to rely heavily on it for power generation. The company’s coal revenue fell 20% in the first half of 2024, but this investment plan aims to strengthen its position even as coal demand faces growing environmental challenges. Semirara’s expansion will focus on its Antique mining site, with coal being exported to key markets like China and South Korea.

### Private Equity's Exit Moves Could Cut Bank Fees

Private equity firms are[ tweaking](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/10/14/private-equity-firms-exit-tactics-risk-curbing-fees-for-banks/) their debt strategies, introducing "portability" features to avoid refinancing obligations when companies are sold. This move benefits private equity by ensuring deals get done in a tough M&A market but is bad news for banks, who miss out on lucrative refinancing fees. Deals like the buyouts of Stada Arzneimittel and Techem GmbH are examples of how firms are using this tactic to keep borrowing intact. As banks settle for smaller roles in these transactions, the outlook for underwriting profits is less optimistic.

### Optimizely Secures $1.1B Debt Refinancing Amid Sale Rumors

Golub Capital is[ leading](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/10/14/golub-leads-11-billion-debt-refinancing-effort-for-optimizely/) a $1.1 billion debt refinancing deal for Optimizely, a software company known for its website optimization tools. The refinancing deal includes portability features, allowing the debt to stay in place even if Optimizely is sold. As private equity firms face limited exit options due to rising interest rates and a slow M&A market, deals like this give them flexibility. Optimizely, owned by Insight Partners, is among several firms using this approach to navigate the uncertain market while still preparing for a potential sale next year.

### Chinese Hedge Fund Buys the Dip in Tech Stocks

A top-performing Chinese hedge fund, Huaan Hexin, is[ seizing](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/11/hedge-fund-up-800-in-seven-years-buys-dip-in-china-tech-stocks/) the opportunity to buy the dip in Chinese tech stocks after a recent slump in the Hang Seng Tech Index. Founder Yuan Wei believes that despite the market volatility, these stocks are undervalued compared to their fundamentals. The firm’s flagship fund has already surged 60% this year, driven by the government’s economic stimulus and a strong rally in internet stocks. Yuan remains bullish on companies like Alibaba and Tencent, viewing them as safe bets with strong profit potential, even amid China’s economic challenges.

### Hedge Funds Cut Bearish Brent Bets Amid War Tensions

Hedge funds are[ slashing](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/10/11/hedge-funds-dump-bets-against-brent-at-fastest-pace-in-8-years/) bearish bets on Brent crude oil at the fastest pace in nearly eight years. With rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly concerns about potential retaliation against Iran, investors are steering clear of betting against rising oil prices. Bullish positions on Brent and WTI oil have surged, with speculators also increasing bets on gasoline prices. As the markets brace for further developments, hedge funds are betting on oil remaining strong in the short term, reflecting the global uncertainty in energy markets.

![Semirara’s $5B expansion and Horizon Robotics IPO developments](/images/oct-15--semirara-s-5b-expansion--horizon-robotics-ipo-a-gyMj.webp)

Hedge funds[ posted](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-up-1-22-in-september-says-ssc-globeop/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20gained%201.22%25%20in,Index%20declined%200.44%25%20in%20October.) a 1.22% gain in September, according to SS&C GlobeOp’s Hedge Fund Performance Index. While market volatility and rising interest rates have created challenges, hedge funds continue to generate attractive returns. However, capital flows into hedge funds declined by 0.44% in October due to portfolio rebalancing. Investors are still looking to hedge funds to navigate inflation, volatility, and economic uncertainty, providing opportunities for alpha generation even in challenging market conditions.
