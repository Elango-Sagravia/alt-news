Leveraged loan defaults saw a decline in July, with the payment default rate dropping to 1.45% by issuer count.

This surge in restructurings pushed the combined default rate to 4.02%, its lowest level since late 2023. Despite these positive signs, ongoing market challenges continue to pose risks. The trend reflects a broader market effort to manage debt more effectively, even as economic pressures remain.

These figures significantly widen from previous estimates, signaling a cautious outlook as economic uncertainties mount. The euro high-yield market, in particular, shows minimal pricing for potential recession risks, prompting concerns that investors may be underestimating the impact of a potential economic downturn.
