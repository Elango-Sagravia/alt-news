In a rare move, ex-hedge fund manager Aaron Barnes, through Newmarket Capital, is[ buying](https://www.hedgeweek.com/ex-hedge-fund-manager-strikes-rare-emerging-market-risk-transfer-deal/#:~:text=An%20ex%2Dhedge%20fund%20manager,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.) part of the risk from a $1 billion Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan portfolio. The transfer allows the IDB to reduce its mezzanine risk exposure by 10%, freeing up as much as $500 million for new loans in Latin America and the Caribbean. With backing from insurers like Axa and Axis Capital, and Banco Santander structuring the deal, IDB hopes this model will scale up lending capacity for poverty alleviation and environmental protection in the region.

### Elliott Pushes Citgo Bid Amid Criticism

Hedge fund Elliott Investment Management is[ defending](https://www.hedgeweek.com/elliott-defends-citgo-bid-amid-creditor-pushback/) its $7.3 billion bid for Citgo Petroleum, despite creditor pushback. Elliott argues that Citgo’s assets are losing value and no better offers are likely to surface. Through subsidiary Amber Energy, Elliott aims to set aside $2 billion for Venezuela bondholder lawsuits and seeks legal protection from further claims. Citgo is at the heart of a U.S. auction to satisfy Venezuela’s $21 billion in defaults. With debt commitments from Barclays and Citibank, Elliott says its offer is the best chance for creditors to recover payments.

### Bridgewater Flags Fed Independence Concerns

Bridgewater Associates is[ eyeing](https://www.hedgeweek.com/bridgewater-flags-fed-independence-as-key-us-election-issue/) the U.S. Federal Reserve’s independence as a key issue in the upcoming presidential election. Greg Jensen, co-chief investment officer, highlighted concerns over potential political interference in the Fed, especially given Republican candidate Donald Trump’s comments about influencing interest rates.

### Australia’s Mega-Pensions Shift to Private Assets

Australia’s largest pension funds, AustralianSuper and Australian Retirement Trust, are[ ramping up](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/10/24/australias-top-pension-funds-to-add-billions-in-private-assets/) private asset investments, eyeing real estate, infrastructure, and private equity.

AustralianSuper plans to boost private holdings to over 30% of its $226 billion portfolio in the next few years, while ART aims to increase exposure to unlisted assets.
