### Traders Shift to Short Dollar Positions

Speculative traders have [turned bearish on the dollar](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/08/30/speculative-traders-turn-short-dollar-as-fed-rate-cuts-loom/) for the first time since February, with $9.8 billion in bets against the currency. This shift comes as the Federal Reserve prepares for potential interest rate cuts in September. Hedge funds are now taking a bullish stance on the euro while betting against the Mexican peso. The dollar's 1.6% decline in August has prompted these moves, though some analysts, like those at Goldman Sachs, caution against expecting further significant weakening without changes in growth and asset returns.

### Hedge Funds and Wind Power Firms Clash in Taiwan Swap Markets

In Taiwan's swap markets, there's a noticeable gap between [deliverable and non-deliverable](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/hedge-funds-clash-with-wind-power-firms-in-taiwan-swap-markets) 10-year Taiwan dollar interest rate swaps due to different expectations on interest rates. Hedge funds are betting on rate cuts, while wind power companies are hedging their borrowing costs.

Reaction Engines Ltd., a UK-based company developing hypersonic rocket engines, has seen its [valuation slashed by over £200 million](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/08/30/bae-backed-uk-rocket-engine-maker-has-value-cut-by-225-million/) by key investors. Artemis Fund Managers and Schroders have both reduced their stakes due to slower-than-expected revenue growth.

The company's technology, which promises significant advancements in air and space travel, has faced delays in commercialization, leading to this substantial valuation reduction.

### Hedge Fund Traders Experience Losses

Several hedge fund traders faced [significant losses](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/08/30/bluecrest-millennium-pods-faced-quick-closure-after-turmoil/) during the market turmoil in early August, resulting in the closure of trading positions and teams at firms like Millennium Management and BlueCrest Capital.

Despite the challenging environment, many multi-strategy hedge funds remain on track to deliver positive returns for the month. This situation underscores the rigorous risk management practices employed by these firms to protect against sustained losses.
