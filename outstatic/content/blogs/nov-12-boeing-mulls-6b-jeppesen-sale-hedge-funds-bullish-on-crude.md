His hedge fund capitalized on soaring stock prices, rising U.S. Treasury yields, and a stronger dollar.

### Hedge funds boost bullish bets on WTI Crude

![Hedge funds boost net long positions on WTI crude](/images/hedge-funds-up-bullish-wti-bets-to-highest-level-since-march-g2Nj.webp)

Hedge funds are betting big on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, with net long positions at their[ highest](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-up-bullish-wti-bets-to-highest-level-since-march/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20have%20boosted%20their,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.) since March. Driven by OPEC+ delaying output hikes and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, hedge funds see potential for WTI prices to keep climbing. Increased demand for oil amid fears of supply disruptions is also contributing to this bullish stance. For energy market watchers, this move signals that WTI could continue its upward trend as hedge funds back oil’s ongoing demand.

### BRIEFS

**Private Equity**

**→ Montel Group acquires SKM Market Predictor:** Montel Group, a Riverside-backed energy data firm, has[ acquired](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/riversides-montel-group-to-acquire-skm-market-predictor/) SKM Market Predictor, which provides insights into the Nordic power and renewables markets. SKM's tools, like the SYSPOWER platform, add advanced forecasting to Montel’s offerings, including daily price forecasts for power and renewables. This is Montel’s fourth acquisition since partnering with Riverside, and it expands their capabilities in energy data analytics.

**→ Boeing explores sale of Jeppesen unit:** Boeing is considering[ selling](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/boeing-mulls-6bn-sale-of-jeppesen-navigation-unit-piquing-pe-interest/#:~:text=Boeing%20is%20evaluating%20a%20potential,a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg%20News.) its Jeppesen navigation unit, which could be valued at around $6 billion. Jeppesen specializes in-flight navigation and planning, making it attractive for investors focused on aviation tech. With Boeing’s fundraising underway, this sale would allow the company to focus on its core areas. Private equity firms and strategic buyers are expected to show strong interest, especially given Jeppesen’s recurring revenue model in an industry with growing demand for advanced tech solutions.

**Hedge funds**

**→ SFERS adds $67M to Hedge, VC Funds:** San Francisco’s city retirement system[ added](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/sfers-ups-hedge-fund-and-vc-fund-allocations-by-67m/) $67 million to its alternative investments. It invested $50 million more into Voleon Capital’s hedge fund and $17 million in a Lilly Asia Ventures fund. SFERS has been growing its hedge fund and VC allocations, focusing on diversifying its portfolio. With ongoing market volatility, this decision reflects SFERS' aim to secure steady returns through diversified investments.

**→ Raptor Group backs distressed housing fund:** Raptor Group, led by investor Jim Pallotta, has seeded a new hedge fund called Trevally Capital, targeting distressed areas in the U.S. housing market. Trevally will trade in residential mortgage-backed securities, especially those impacted by rising mortgage rates and financial strain on homeowners. With[ $100 million](https://www.hedgeweek.com/raptor-group-invests-in-hedge-fund-targeting-distressed-us-housing-market/) already raised, Raptor sees potential in this market, given homebuyers' economic challenges. Trevally aims for double-digit returns by focusing on areas with high mortgage-related stress, giving Raptor a strong play in distressed housing assets.

**Venture Capital**

**→ Faber launches fund for deep tech startups:** Lisbon-based VC Faber just[ closed](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/06/faber-launches-third-vc-fund-with-34m-first-close-aims-for-64m/) the first round of its €64 million fund, focusing on deep tech startups across Southern Europe. Backed by major investors like the European Investment Fund and Portugal’s Caixa Capital, this fund will invest in early-stage tech—think AI, robotics, and biotech. With scientific talent drawn to Spain and Portugal, Faber is betting on this region as the next hub for innovation.

**→ Forerunner raises $500M for consumer tech:** Forerunner Ventures [closed](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/forerunner-consumer-tech-vc-that-backed-warby-parker-away-raises-500m-fund-vii) its seventh fund with $500 million, focusing on consumer tech. Known for backing big names like Warby Parker and Glossier, Forerunner will keep its focus on new consumer tech, writing checks between $1 million and $20 million for early-stage companies. Despite the pullback in consumer tech investments, Forerunner’s founder, Kirsten Green, remains optimistic about AI-powered consumer products.

**Others**

**→ Icelandic Pension funds reject bank rules:** Icelandic pension funds oppose new regulations treating them like banks and insurers, citing their unique structure and social role. The Central Bank of Iceland[ suggests](https://www.ipe.com/news/icelands-pension-funds-reject-idea-of-subjecting-them-to-bank-rules/10076748.article) aligning rules for greater financial stability, as pension funds now hold assets totaling 184% of the nation’s GDP. Pension funds, however, argue they have a distinct purpose, rooted in labor-market contributions, and don't want to be bound by the same regulations as commercial banks. This clash sparks a debate on pension funds' role in the financial system and whether stricter oversight is necessary.

**→ ABN Amro sells $3.2B infrastructure loans:** Dutch bank [ABN Amro is selling](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-11/abn-amro-puts-3-billion-of-infrastructure-loans-up-for-sale?srnd=phx-alternative-investments) €3 billion of infrastructure loans, with Morgan Stanley handling the deal. The Dutch government plans to reduce its stake in ABN, shifting the bank’s focus to consumer lending. The sale helps ABN reduce exposure to infrastructure risks, especially given inflation and economic uncertainty. Infrastructure assets have become tricky for banks, so shedding this portfolio aligns with ABN’s strategy to streamline operations.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why do high oil prices affect some economies differently than others?**

![High oil prices benefit exporters like Saudi Arabia but strain importers like Japan with inflation and rising costs](/images/why-do-high-oil-prices-affect-some-economies-more-than-others-M0Mj.webp)

High oil prices hit economies with varying intensities. Oil-importing countries, like Japan and Germany, are particularly vulnerable because they rely heavily on imported energy. Rising oil prices inflate domestic production costs, increase inflation, and strain consumer spending in these economies.

In contrast, oil-exporting nations like Saudi Arabia and Russia benefit from price surges, as higher revenue from oil exports strengthens their fiscal balances and boosts economic growth. The United States is in a unique position; as a major producer, high prices benefit its oil industry, yet the broader economy faces inflationary pressures and higher costs for transportation and manufacturing. Oil price volatility can ultimately fuel economic disparities, benefiting oil exporters while challenging oil-importing countries.

### WHAT IS

**EBITDA**

EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. It’s a way to measure how much money a company makes from its regular business activities without factoring in things like taxes, interest on loans, and how much its equipment or buildings lose value over time (depreciation) or the cost of spreading out large expenses (amortization).

Imagine if you were running a lemonade stand. EBITDA would be the money you made just from selling lemonade, without considering whether you borrowed money to start the stand, how much you have to pay in taxes, or if your lemonade stand’s equipment gets older over time.

EBITDA helps you understand how well a company is doing at its core business before all the extra financial stuff gets in the way.
