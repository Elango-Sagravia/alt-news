### Tema Endowment ETF Channels University Playbook

The Tema Endowment ETF is [bringing](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/etfs/2024/09/17/an-endowment-etf-plans-to-ride-wall-streets-private-asset-craze/) university endowment strategies to retail investors. It will split holdings across equities, fixed income, and private investments, following the playbook of giants like Yale’s endowment. About 50% will go toward equities or derivatives, and up to 15% in less liquid “other securities.” This ETF reflects a growing trend of giving everyday investors access to private markets, which are valued at over $13 trillion. Apollo Global and BondBloxx are also launching similar products as demand for diversified investments continues to grow.

!["JPMorgan may take over Apple’s credit card from Goldman Sachs](/images/18th-sept--patria-s--100m-fund--jpmorgan-eyes-apple-card-a-M1ND.jpg)

JPMorgan is in [talks](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/17/jpmorgan-joins-suitors-for-apple-card-that-goldman-wants-to-shed/) with Apple to potentially take over its credit card business from Goldman Sachs. Goldman, which partnered with Apple about five years ago, is exiting the consumer banking space. Other contenders for the Apple Card include Synchrony Financial and Capital One. While JPMorgan’s interest doesn’t guarantee a deal, it highlights the ongoing reshuffle in the credit card industry. If successful, this move could strengthen JPMorgan's position as a top credit card issuer and bolster Apple's push to expand its services division.

Gary Stein is back in banking, [joining](https://www.hedgeweek.com/ex-goldman-sachs-md-goes-back-to-banking-with-hsbc-after-brief-millennium-stay/#:~:text=Gary%20Stein%2C%20a%20former%20managing,a%20report%20by%20eFinancial%20Careers.) HSBC’s Latin American FX team in New York after a brief stint at hedge fund Millennium. Stein, a former Goldman Sachs managing director, left Millennium after less than 18 months. His move to HSBC comes as the bank strengthens its FX operations, leveraging its extensive commercial banking network. With Stein’s experience in managing FX portfolios at top-tier institutions, HSBC is poised to maintain its strong presence in the Latin American FX market, while Stein’s return to banking appears to be a strategic career move.

### Kuvari Partners Turns Into Family Office

Hedge fund Kuvari Partners is [returning](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/17/vikram-kumars-hedge-fund-kuvari-to-return-external-capital/) external capital as founder Vikram Kumar transitions the firm into a family office. Kumar cites market challenges, personal reasons, and the rise of multistrategy giants dominating mid-cap stocks as key factors. Kuvari’s long-term stock-picking strategy struggled in the current market environment, where volatility and concentration of returns in mega-cap stocks have made it tough for smaller hedge funds. Despite attractive opportunities, Kumar doesn’t foresee them materializing soon. The decision also aligns with his desire to rebalance family priorities after 17 years of running the firm.

Newmont, the world’s top gold producer, plans to [raise](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/17/newmont-is-on-track-to-get-at-least-2-billion-from-asset-sales-coo-says/) $2 billion by selling smaller mines and development projects. After acquiring Newcrest Mining in 2023, the company is streamlining its portfolio to focus on Tier 1 assets—mines capable of producing at least 500,000 ounces of gold annually for a decade. They’re in the process of selling assets in Australia, Ghana, and North America, including the Akyem mine in Ghana. Newmont’s goal is to wrap up these deals by the first quarter of 2025, further boosting its exposure to copper along the way.

### Hedge Funds Are Buying Financial Stocks Again

Hedge funds are diving back into financial stocks, especially banks, insurance companies, and trading firms. This marks their [fastest](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-switch-focus-to-financial-sector-stocks/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20have%20returned%20to,brokerage%20division%20at%20Goldman%20Sachs.) buying spree since June 2023, following weeks of net selling in the sector. Hedge funds are taking long positions, betting on rising asset prices, particularly in North America and Europe. However, despite this surge, hedge funds remain net sellers in global equities, reflecting broader caution. As the S&P 500 saw a 4% gain recently, stock-picking hedge funds enjoyed a 0.42% weekly increase, though systematic traders experienced a slight loss.

### Brevan Howard Hires JPMorgan’s Tech Executive

Brevan Howard has [recruited](https://www.hedgeweek.com/brevan-howard-taps-jpmorgan-technologist-for-cto-role/#:~:text=Brevan%20Howard%20has%20become%20the,a%20report%20by%20eFinancial%20Careers.) Mike Sanders from JPMorgan to be its new Global Chief Technology Officer. Sanders previously served as JPMorgan’s EMEA Chief Information Officer and held senior tech roles at both JPMorgan and Citi, overseeing macro and FX technology. His move to Brevan Howard marks the hedge fund’s push to strengthen its tech team as it competes with major financial institutions. This appointment reflects a broader trend of hedge funds hiring top talent from the banking sector to enhance their technological edge in today’s competitive landscape.

### Hedge Funds Post Gains Despite Market Volatility

Hedge funds recorded a 0.75% [return](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-up-0-75-in-august-says-ssc-globeop/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20advanced%200.75%25%20in,%2C%20advanced%200.39%25%20for%20September.) in August, according to the SS&C GlobeOp Hedge Fund Performance Index. September also saw positive net flows, with the Capital Movement Index rising 0.39%. Hedge funds continue to attract investor capital, offering flexible strategies and downside protection during volatile times. With global market volatility trending upward, hedge funds’ ability to deliver attractive, risk-adjusted returns is driving continued interest. As traditional markets face headwinds, hedge funds remain a go-to option for investors seeking diversification and growth opportunities.

### Patria Investments Launches $100 Million Reforestation Fund

Patria Investments is [raising](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/commodities/2024/09/17/alternative-investment-firm-launches-brazil-reforestation-fund/) $100 million for its first reforestation fund. The plan? Buy degraded land, plant native trees like rosewood, and sell high-value timber like African mahogany. They’re also cultivating cacao and coffee to create a "symbiotic" ecosystem. Unlike other funds, Patria is focusing on the Atlantic rainforest, avoiding remote areas like the Amazon. The goal is to return investor capital within 15 years, with annual yields projected up to 12%. Plus, carbon credits will boost returns, thanks to help from Pachama Inc., which will monitor land using satellites and AI.
