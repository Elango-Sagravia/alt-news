### **Is Trend Micro Heading for a Major Buyout?**

Trend Micro Inc. (4704 JP) might be on the brink of a significant sale, as reported by Reuters, which sent its ADRs soaring by 10%. The company’s co-founders, now in their late 60s and 70s, may be considering a sale as part of succession planning. Activist investor ValueAct has been pressuring the company, though its stock has remained stagnant in recent years. Given the high multiples involved, a strategic buyer seems more likely than a private equity firm. Speculation is growing on who might step in, how much they would pay, and the strategic benefits they could gain.

The merger process between Celltrion Inc. and Celltrion Pharm is gaining momentum, with a decision expected within months. Korean law allows the merger to proceed as a small-scale merger if Celltrion Pharm's market cap remains below one-tenth of Celltrion's, bypassing the need for shareholder approval. This predictability allows investors to strategize around merger swap spreads and appraisal rights. Positioning ahead of the final decision could yield significant benefits as the merger progresses.

### **SoftBank's AI Ambitions Surge Amid Market Turmoil**

Japan's SoftBank Group remains bullish on AI investments despite narrowing its net loss to ¥174.3 billion ($1.2 billion) in Q2 2024, down from ¥477.6 billion a year prior. The Vision Fund, rebounding with a ¥1.9 billion gain, highlights the rising value of crucial portfolio companies like ByteDance and Coupang. However, SoftBank faced a sharp $15 billion drop in market value following Japan's interest rate hike. Undeterred, SoftBank plans a ¥500 billion share buyback and continues its AI push with new investments in Wiz, AlphaSense, and a $200 million stake in Tempus AI, underscoring its strategic focus on logistics, robotics, and autonomous driving.
