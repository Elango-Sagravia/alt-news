Hedge fund allocators are growing concerned about crowding as they consolidate portfolios into fewer, larger funds. A new Bank of America survey[ found](https://www.hedgeweek.com/crowding-is-major-hedge-fund-allocator-concern/) that investors are moving away from diversification, instead favoring big multi-manager funds like Millennium and Citadel.

### Brazilian Hedge Funds Score Big on Rate Bets

Brazilian hedge funds had a rare [win](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/15/bearish-rate-bets-hand-win-to-brazils-battered-hedge-funds/) in September, thanks to bets on higher local rates and lower yields abroad. Funds like Legacy Capital and Ace Capital posted their best returns of the year as Brazil's fiscal outlook fueled rising swap rates. Hedge funds are skeptical about the government's ability to stabilize public debt, which has led to increased pessimism on domestic assets. An index tracking Brazil's hedge funds rose 1.1% last month, outpacing the broader benchmark. Despite challenges, these funds are finding opportunities in the country’s uncertain fiscal environment.
