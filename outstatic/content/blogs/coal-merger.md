### Hong Kong’s SVI Shuts Down China Fund

Strategic Vision Investment (SVI), a Hong Kong-based hedge fund, has [closed its China-focused](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/hong-kongs-svi-winds-down-china-focused-hedge-fund-say-sources-2024-08-20/) Value Multiplier Fund. The decision comes amid growing geopolitical tensions and challenges in the region. The fund’s holdings were liquidated, and capital returned to investors. SVI, which rebranded in 2020, now plans to shift its focus to managing wealth for affluent families, transitioning into a multi-family office. Despite a strong annualized return of 28% since 2020, the fund’s closure highlights the difficulties of navigating China’s investment landscape in the current climate.

### Hedge Funds Use USD for Carry Trades

Hedge funds are back in the carry trade game, but this time, they’re [borrowing US dollars](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/08/20/citi-says-hedge-funds-are-using-dollars-for-new-carry-trades/) instead of yen. With expectations of US interest rate cuts and Japan’s recent rate hike, hedge funds are using the greenback to fund bets on emerging-market currencies like the Brazilian real and Turkish lira. The shift marks a change from the old model of borrowing yen at low rates. However, Citi warns that this strategy might be short-lived, especially with the US presidential election on the horizon, which could bring more volatility. For now, though, the dollar is the funding currency of choice.

### Mega-Cap Tech Stocks Dominate Portfolios

Mega-cap tech stocks continue to be the [top picks for hedge funds](https://www.hedgeweek.com/mega-cap-tech-stocks-continue-to-dominate-hedge-fund-equity-investment-portfolios/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20tech%20stocks%20account%20for,and%20Taiwan%20Semiconductor%20Manufacturing%20Co.), with Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple leading the charge. These tech giants hold the top six spots in hedge fund portfolios despite being underweight compared to the broader S&P 500 index. Nvidia, which has skyrocketed nearly 170% year-to-date, is also a favorite. New entrants like Spotify and GE Vernova are making waves too. Tech stocks might be dominant, but hedge funds are still cautious, keeping their allocations in check. It’s clear that tech remains the cornerstone of many portfolios, even in a volatile market.

![Coal merger, Tokyo Tower bid, and tech stock surge on August 22](/images/22nd-aug_-coal-merger--tokyo-tower-bid--tech-surge-a--1--AyNj.webp)

Arch Resources and Consol Energy are [merging in a $2.3 billion deal](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/consol-energy-arch-resources-merge-create-5-bln-coal-mining-entity-2024-08-21/#:~:text=Commodities-,Consol%20Energy%2C%20Arch%20Resources%20strike%20merger%20deal%20to,%245%20billion%20coal%20mining%20giant&text=Aug%2021%20\(Reuters\)%20%2D%20Arch,at%20more%20than%20%245%20billion.) to create a North American coal powerhouse. The combined company, Core Natural Resources, will own 11 mines producing thermal and metallurgical coal, focusing on exporting to global markets. Despite the push for cleaner energy, coal remains crucial for steel production and electricity generation. The deal is expected to close by early 2025, and the new company will have the largest coal export capacity in North America. This merger is a bet on the continued demand for coal, even in a shifting energy landscape.

### Russian Tycoon-Backed Firm Enters UK Property Market

North Wind Capital, backed by Russian financier Boris Mints, is making waves in the [UK property market](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/08/21/firm-backed-by-russian-tycoon-opens-door-into-uk-property-market/) by financing deals that traditional lenders avoid. The firm has carved out a niche by arranging complex transactions, often involving high-end London real estate. Using methods like profit-participation notes, North Wind provides investors with opportunities to gain exposure to prime properties without directly purchasing them. While the firm’s strategy has raised eyebrows among some mainstream investors, it continues to attract high-net-worth individuals.

### KKR and Hulic Bid $2B for Tokyo Skyscraper

KKR and Hulic have teamed up to [bid $2 billion](https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/723667) for Shiodome City Center, a 43-story Tokyo skyscraper owned by Singapore’s GIC. The bid could mark one of Japan’s most expensive office-building deals ever. Tokyo’s office market has remained stable, thanks to low borrowing costs and a weak yen. While work-from-home hasn’t taken off in Japan like in other places, demand for prime office space remains strong. KKR and Hulic’s bid is the only offer on the table, and they may bring in more partners to finalize the deal.
