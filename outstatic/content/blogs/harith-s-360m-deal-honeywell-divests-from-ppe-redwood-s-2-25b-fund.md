### HEADLINES

**Harith acquires African fund for $360M**

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdH_4Bitx3LPRridAyt-uHieV2kLOhD0V3wLJFQ9Jt86HXfkB2mCQPVNLt-yuf_JlhHDj29XGfH6me_nXzUw6-_01O2LjyQJZHYu23VCMJUm3j4pDq9XvxDOvvi_oFDJN4KxDB_Nw?key=xs1jjJphch-SeOW2Q_G5ITyG)**

South Africa’s Harith General Partners is[ buying](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/22/pe-firm-harith-buys-african-infrastructure-fund-for-360-million/) the Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund for $360 million, gaining stakes in Lanseria Airport, Kelvin Power Station, and more. The fund’s investors, including the continent’s largest pension fund and Absa Bank, are cashing out amid sluggish private equity exits. Harith’s CEO sees this as a move to expand influence in Africa’s energy transition. With Africa needing $170 billion annually for infrastructure, this deal positions Harith as a key player in the transition.

**Honeywell offloads PPE business for $1.33B**

Honeywell is[ selling](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/honeywell-sells-ppe-business-to-pe-backed-acquirer#:~:text=Honeywell%20has%20agreed%20to%20sell,to%20strengthen%20their%20balance%20sheets.) its personal protective equipment unit to Odyssey-backed Protective Industrial Products for $1.33 billion. Facing activist investor pressure, Honeywell is exiting non-core assets to focus on automation, aviation, and energy transition. Analysts expect more carveouts as industrial giants navigate inflation and interest rate risks. This aligns with a $15.8 billion trend of industrial divestitures this year. Honeywell recently spun off its advanced materials division, hinting at further restructuring to meet shareholder demands and improve efficiency.

**Spot ETFs' ownership of Bitcoin crosses 1 million**

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXezJ3NKqkfINge3pY7VcNWgZNogCtAukrdjChyZWlemC9MGiyboEaMbYKLpQQzzY-D-CsKcWVYKgSKWdNTT1JCF2PBRsU8SFoGou4Ug1NAMslSQANLt2jghUp5tAm28-oDdX00jEQ?key=xs1jjJphch-SeOW2Q_G5ITyG)**

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, launched earlier this year, have been a driving force behind rising inflows. During the six-day period from November 6 to 13, following the election, these funds attracted a staggering $4.7 billion in net inflows. This surge in interest has propelled US Bitcoin ETFs’ holdings to surpass the significant milestone of 1 million BTC. The rapid accumulation reflects heightened investor confidence, likely driven by broader regulatory clarity and the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a mainstream asset. This development underscores the crucial role of ETFs in facilitating institutional and retail access to the cryptocurrency market.

### BRIEFS

**Private Equity**

→ **Santo Domingo family exits Spanish real estate:** Colombia’s Santo Domingo family is[ selling](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/22/colombian-billionaires-exit-bet-on-spanish-commercial-property/#:~:text=\(Bloomberg\)%20%2D%2D%20Colombia's%20billionaire%20Santo,class%20for%20wealthy%20global%20investors.) its $172 million stake in Spain’s Inmobiliaria Colonial. Once a lucrative investment, Colonial’s office properties have struggled as remote work shifts real estate trends. The family, known for its beer fortune, has focused more on private equity in recent years, backing KKR and 3G Capital. While billionaires like Amancio Ortega remain active in real estate, the Santo Domingos are diversifying away from traditional property investments, opting for private equity growth opportunities.

→ **Goldman Sachs buys Malta’s Melita broadband firm:** Goldman Sachs Asset Management is[ acquiring](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/22/eqt-to-sell-broadband-firm-melita-to-goldman-sachs-unit/) Melita, a Maltese broadband and 5G provider, for $782 million from EQT. Melita’s network reaches 99% of Malta, offering broadband, mobile, and data center services. EQT, which acquired the firm in 2019, invested heavily in its international expansion and AI tools. Goldman’s infrastructure arm has managed $16 billion in assets since 2006.

**Hedge Funds**

→ **Taula sees upside in undervalued EU bonds:** Taula Capital’s Diego Megia believes EU bonds are a[ bargain](https://www.hedgeweek.com/taula-cio-megia-sees-opportunity-in-eu-bonds/), predicting a 40-basis-point spread tightening if reclassified as sovereign debt. Speaking at the Sohn London Conference, he called EU bonds undervalued compared to other top-rated sovereigns. The EU is lobbying for index inclusion to attract investors. Backed by $5 billion, Taula focuses on fixed income and macro strategies. If these bonds gain broader acceptance, it could open a profitable opportunity for global investors amid ongoing debt market shifts.

→ **Redwood plans $2.25B distressed debt fund:** Redwood Capital is[ raising](https://www.hedgeweek.com/redwood-plans-2-25bn-credit-fund-amid-distressed-debt-challenges/#:~:text=Redwood%20Capital%20Management%2C%20an%20opportunistic,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.) $2.25 billion for a new distressed debt fund, building on its strong 2023 performance with a 31.6% net IRR. The firm aims to hold larger positions in restructuring talks, addressing rising creditor conflicts and aggressive liability practices. Despite challenges in the $500 billion distressed debt market, Redwood sees opportunities as interest rates and inflation reshape debt landscapes. The fund launches in mid-2025.

→ **Citadel founder open to minority stake sale:** Ken Griffin, Citadel’s founder, is open to[ selling](https://www.hedgeweek.com/griffin-open-to-selling-minority-citadel-stake/) a minority stake in the multi-strategy hedge fund, citing successful partnerships like Sequoia’s 2022 investment in Citadel Securities. Griffin emphasizes finding the right partner to drive innovation while maintaining Citadel’s private structure. However, he dismissed any plans for a public offering. This comes amid BlackRock’s reported talks to acquire a stake in Millennium, another top hedge fund.

→ **AQR’s tax fund slashes income tax bills:** AQR’s Delphi Plus fund is[ helping](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-22/quant-hedge-fund-aqr-is-cutting-income-tax-bills-for-wealthy-clients?embedded-checkout=true) wealthy clients reduce taxable income, offering deductions against wages and investments. Available only to elite investors, the fund generated ordinary losses equivalent to 31% of invested capital in 2023 while delivering 12.2% pre-tax returns. Using swap contracts to create “ordinary losses,” Delphi Plus exploits tax efficiencies while maintaining a solid investment strategy. With high fees and regulatory barriers, it’s not for everyone, but for top earners, it’s a game-changing tax tool.

**Venture Capital**

→ **Sequoia marks up flagship fund by 25%.** Sequoia Capital[ increased](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/sequoia-marked-up-2020-flagship-vc-fund) the valuation of its 2020 flagship venture fund by 25% over the past year, despite no exits. The fund, focused on AI startups like OpenAI and Harvey AI, reflects the venture market’s dichotomy—rising valuations but low cash distributions. Its TVPI (total value to paid-in capital) improved from 1.13x to 1.34x, but realized gains remain below median.

→ **Inversion raises $44M for space delivery:** Inversion, a space tech company,[ raised](https://vcnewsdaily.com/inversion/venture-capital-funding/ckjcfydwmg) $44 million in a Series A round co-led by Spark Capital and Adjacent. With backing from Lockheed Martin Ventures and Y Combinator, Inversion plans to develop Arc, an autonomous re-entry vehicle for on-demand cargo delivery from orbit. This funding brings Inversion’s total to $54 million. By enabling deliveries to remote areas via space, the company aims to redefine logistics and expand its operations globally, supported by cutting-edge aerospace technology.

**Others**

→ **Kioxia sets IPO price for December debut:** Kioxia, Bain Capital’s memory chip company, is[ planning](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/11/22/bain-backed-kioxia-sets-ipo-price-for-december-tokyo-debut/#:~:text=\(Bloomberg\)%20%2D%2D%20Bain%20Capital%2D,on%20Japan's%20stock%20market%20renewal.) a December IPO in Tokyo, pricing shares at ¥1,390. Expected to raise ¥27.7 billion, the listing values Kioxia at ¥750 billion. Once a Toshiba spin-off, Kioxia has faced challenges in the NAND market due to pricing slumps but is capitalizing on rising chip demand. The IPO follows years of delays and highlights renewed interest in Japan’s stock market. The funds will help Kioxia compete in the capital-intensive memory industry.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What causes a stock market bubble?**

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfhnc0lCa2hWuommxbfdjszsHkslmQMs-YPfMQ7v4bYK2JEpmdAfBw1JCuKdWcU562Bu4AK8SIf-iQefAjcUcgJQGWIX_y1DJa2MVnbLMyUW9OitkP7Jm4ATb66RiZYx4Vb0tFAAw?key=xs1jjJphch-SeOW2Q_G5ITyG)**

A stock market bubble occurs when stock prices soar well above their intrinsic value, driven by speculation, excessive optimism, and investor FOMO (fear of missing out). These bubbles often begin with a disruptive event, like the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, when internet companies saw valuations skyrocket despite many lacking profits—or even viable business models.\
\
Psychological biases, such as herd behavior, are the key reasons that fuel a bubble. Cheap credit and low interest rates can create bubbles too, as seen during the housing market bubble of the mid-2000s, which contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.\
\
Bubbles eventually burst when reality doesn’t align with expectations—like the dot-com bubble in 2000, where speculative buying and leverage collapsed under weak fundamentals.

### WHAT IS

**Demand Elasticity**

Demand elasticity measures how sensitive the demand for a product is to changes in its price. If a small price change leads to a big shift in demand, the product is considered “elastic.” For example, if a small price increase causes people to stop buying a certain brand of soda, that soda has high demand elasticity.
