UK regulators are [delving](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/09/05/private-equitys-favorite-borrowing-tool-sparks-fresh-scrutiny/) into how banks help private equity firms add debt to their funds through net-asset-value (NAV) loans. These loans allow firms to borrow against companies they own, adding a layer of risk because the loans stack on top of existing debt. While NAV loans have been around for years, their popularity surged due to slower dealmaking, making them a critical liquidity tool. However, concerns linger about the risks to banks, especially if underlying assets drop in value. The Bank of England is closely watching the impact on financial stability.
