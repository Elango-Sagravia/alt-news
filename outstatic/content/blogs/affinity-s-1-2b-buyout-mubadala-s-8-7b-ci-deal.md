Hong Kong’s Affinity Equity Partners just pulled off Southeast Asia’s[ biggest](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/affinitys-1-2b-yupi-acquisition-marks-largest-buyout-deal-in-se-asia-this-year#:~:text=Hong%20Kong%2Dbased%20Affinity%20Equity,started%20the%20company%20in%201996.) buyout this year—snapping up Indonesian gummy candy maker Yupi for $1.2 billion. Yupi, known for supplying sweet treats to over 50 countries, saw its founders exit after nearly three decades. This isn’t Affinity’s only splash; it also acquired Golden Fresh, a seafood processor, for $450 million. Private equity in Southeast Asia is heating up, with deal values rebounding 50% this year to hit $8.1 billion. High economic growth and a young population fuel optimism, but diverse regulations and tricky exits keep things challenging.

Buffett is loading up on cash

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeFk3We56fpVR1Tm7dDkYQoLXyvY1PV4TPE3jWQOsez2RCHbmJ-7c8tZxL_0nDpMwCEdOG_8_VF7nAaLaVj_tSomH6fJorP9j-qX490ToJ1vSHSMpS3cQCcT5fqDtguDE5ls2HKiw?key=WeZyEeNdnISJr58pVhp6E9q0)

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significantly increased its cash allocation, now at nearly 28% of total assets, marking the highest level since the 1980s. Historically, Berkshire’s cash strategy has mirrored market cycles, with substantial builds during periods of elevated valuations, such as the dot-com crash and financial crisis, and deployments during downturns when bargains emerge.

This disciplined approach is rooted in Buffett’s view that high market valuations signal lower future returns. With the U.S. stock market’s valuation-to-GDP ratio at record highs and the S&P 500’s expected 4% annual return over the next decade lagging risk-free Treasury yields, Berkshire’s growing cash reserve reflects a cautious stance. This highlights Buffett’s emphasis on long-term opportunity over short-term speculation, suggesting Berkshire is poised to capitalize on future market corrections.

Private Equity

**→  Spain’s IPO market eyes 2025 reboot:** Spain is[ hoping](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/26/spain-looks-to-big-private-equity-deals-to-kickstart-ipo-market/) two private equity-backed IPOs—Blackstone-owned Cirsa Enterprises and HBX Group—will jumpstart its listings in 2025, targeting €1 billion each. This follows a rocky year despite Puig’s €2.6 billion IPO. Tough earnings and geopolitical jitters, like Trump’s trade tariffs, have made firms cautious. Still, Spain’s economy is outperforming its neighbors, growing at 3% this year.

**→  Stonepeak-backed Digital Edge eyes $500M loan:** Digital Edge DC, a data center operator backed by Stonepeak Infrastructure,[ plans](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/26/stonepeak-backed-digital-edge-mulls-loan-for-india-data-centers/) a $400-$500 million loan to fund its Navi Mumbai project in India. This 300 MW data hub, dubbed BOM1, is set to launch its first phase in early 2025. The data center boom continues, fueled by rising AI demands. Digital Edge isn’t alone; Malaysia-based projects are also seeking private debt.

**Hedge Funds**

**→  Millennium backs hedge fund teams with $1.8B:** Millennium Management is[ allocating](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/26/millennium-backs-two-hedge-fund-teams-with-about-18-billion/) $1.8 billion to two hedge fund teams. Scopia Capital gets $1 billion to manage in a market-neutral strategy, while ex-Kepos Capital pros Chris Tuzzo and Warren Empey are taking $800 million for NorthArrow Capital. Millennium’s multistrat model, managing $70.2 billion, is known for its external partnerships. About 10% of its investment teams come from external managers, reflecting a trend of standalone funds attracting multistrats’ capital.

**→  Quant Olympics hunts finance stars:** WorldQuant’s Quant Championship[ crowned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-11-25/at-singapore-hosted-quant-olympics-competitors-pitch-new-investing-strategies?embedded-checkout=true) Taiwan’s “Ruff Boys” as winners after they outshone 37,300 contestants. The global competition, hosted in Singapore, challenges students to develop quant strategies for real-world trading. Ruff Boys, university students from Taiwan, nailed it with their predictive models, earning $20,000 and career-defining exposure.

**→  Pershing Square bets big on Brookfield:** Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital has[ built](https://www.hedgeweek.com/pershing-square-builds-2-6bn-stake-in-brookfield-corp/) a $2.6 billion stake in Brookfield Corp., now its second-largest holding. Brookfield, a Toronto-based global infrastructure giant, owns critical assets like AI-driven data centers and renewable energy sources. Ackman sees significant upside, noting Brookfield trades at 15x earnings versus peers like KKR (27x). Since April, Brookfield’s stock has surged 40%, and Pershing expects it to double in coming years.

**Venture Capital**

**→  Australia’s PE growth deals hit record:** Australia’s private equity growth investments[ reached](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/australia-pe-growth-deals-record#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20a%20banner,year%20yet%20for%20the%20category.) $6.5 billion in 2024, breaking previous records. Notable deals include Global Infrastructure Partners and Mubadala backing Perdaman with $4.2 billion—Australia’s largest growth investment ever—and Blackstone’s $488 million stake in Symphony Infra Partners. Growth PE has jumped to 17.4% of total investments, reflecting the sector’s rising appeal despite Australia’s low-return profile. While overall PE activity has generated less exit value than investments, firms are betting on the region’s stability and opportunities in areas like energy transition and infrastructure development.

**→  Cleo Capital launches cybersecurity accelerator:** Cleo Capital is[ taking](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/cleo-capital-launches-cybersecurity-accelerator-to-help-undo-the-crushing-burden-of-online-threats/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE617PIQz0R_5CyiNIj-v6VS8P_E6L3svnZCDftnDF7SMkAI7SacZXbA_KEe4ZV4DHiA7n_qFrk2X8R_gxF83wkJuaq4qjW271XMeAPsU4Yz0ZA57Ca6kKSSyLyM1PYcdjE0kK0up6IZw9HGGD9uNu_dMI7JxJbh8pwC6YVZ-XW6) on cybersecurity threats with a new accelerator program. Targeting pre-seed and seed startups, the 12-week program offers $250,000 for 7% equity. Founder Sarah Kunst, inspired by her family’s experience with cyber fraud, wants to address online scams and privacy issues. The FBI reported $12.5 billion in cybercrime losses in 2023, underscoring the need for innovation. Cleo’s accelerator is open to startups in consumer, defense, and dev tools, with applications closing January 20. Kunst believes this program is the first step in reshaping the internet into a safer, more trusted space for everyone.

The $250 million bribery scandal has delayed compliance with India’s law requiring non-founders to own 25% of a listed firm. Adani Wilmar, a leader in cooking oils and food products, was set to sell shares by February but will now seek an extension. The allegations, which Adani denies, have caused ripple effects across the conglomerate. The company faces mounting pressure to resolve regulatory issues while navigating the fallout from the bribery accusations.

Why do currencies depreciate during a recession?

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdKkuxzF3No7sc5sHVDCml7kz8wf7pbdw_SAD_F558cNIop0NU1LOybzjcmF_h3fW_l8WfE3XX51tAEJ94erVK2SZfI1WbLpkerQGafhDzgnnh1i-oQI4l5iSe1cORPSGj4bv3keg?key=WeZyEeNdnISJr58pVhp6E9q0)

Currencies often depreciate during a recession due to weakened economic fundamentals and shifts in investor sentiment. A recession signals declining economic activity, reduced consumer spending, and falling business investments, leading to lower demand for the currency in global markets.\
\
Central banks typically respond by cutting interest rates or implementing quantitative easing to stimulate growth. Lower interest rates make the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns, further pressuring its value. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate cuts contributed to dollar depreciation.\
\
Additionally, recessions can trigger capital outflows as investors seek safer assets like gold or the currencies of more stable economies. Emerging market currencies are particularly vulnerable, as their economies often rely heavily on foreign investments. However, the extent of depreciation varies, with safe-haven currencies like the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen sometimes gaining value during global recessions.

### WHAT IS

**Margin call**

A margin call happens when an investor’s account balance falls below a required level. If you borrow money from your broker to buy stocks and the stock prices drop, the broker might ask you to deposit more money to cover the loss. It’s like a wake-up call from your lender to “top up” your account.
