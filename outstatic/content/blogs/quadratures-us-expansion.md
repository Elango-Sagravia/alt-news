### Rokos Hedge Fund Suffers Steep Losses

Rokos Capital Management had a rough August, with its macro strategy [down](https://www.hedgeweek.com/rokos-macro-fund-down-5-amid-august-market-volatility/) 5.2%, marking one of its worst monthly performances since its 2015 inception. Market volatility, spurred by US recession fears, caused a selloff that impacted many macro hedge funds. Despite the losses, the fund is still up 14% year-to-date, but the downturn highlights the challenging market conditions. Other major hedge funds like Millennium Management and Balyasny were also affected as global markets swung, driven by uncertainties in the US and Japan.

Vista Equity Partners is [considering](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/18/vista-picks-evercore-to-help-sell-finastras-capital-markets-arm/) selling Finastra’s Treasury and Capital Markets business, with estimates valuing the unit at $2 billion. The division, which provides financial institutions with software for processing trades and managing risk, generates about $200 million in annual earnings. Vista has been working with Evercore Inc. to explore the potential sale, but no final decision has been made yet. Finastra was formed in 2017 from the merger of Misys Group and D+H Corp, and this sale could be part of Vista’s broader strategy to optimize its portfolio.

![Japan’s market volatility drives hedge funds to expand teams](/images/19th-sept--quadrature-s-us-expansion--rokos-losses--japan-hedge-fund-moves-b-A4Mz.webp)

With market volatility shaking Japan's financial landscape, major hedge funds are beefing up their Japan-focused teams. Firms like Brevan Howard and Millennium Management have [hired](https://www.hedgeweek.com/brevan-howard-and-millennium-add-to-japan-focused-trading-teams/) experienced traders to capitalize on the country's shifting monetary policy. Recent appointments include Tomoki Kondo at Brevan Howard and Yasuhiro Hasegawa at Millennium. Japan’s market faced dramatic swings after the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike, causing chaos in the yen and bond markets. Hedge funds are now keen to navigate these fluctuations, seizing opportunities amid the ongoing turbulence in Japan’s stock and bond markets.

### Quadrature Expands with New York Office

Quadrature is [opening](https://www.hedgeweek.com/quadrature-hires-jpmorgan-md-as-part-of-us-push/) a New York office in the iconic Puck Building this autumn. Heath Windcliff, a JPMorgan veteran, is among the notable hires joining the team. He brings over two decades of experience in electronic trading and quantitative research. Joining Windcliff are Simon Thornington from Two Sigma and William Levine from Citadel, further strengthening the firm’s US operations.

### Hedge Funds Maintain Winning Streak in August

Hedge funds had another [positive](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-up-for-fourth-month-in-a-row-in-august/) month in August, extending their winning streak to four months. According to Citco, funds returned an average of 1.1%, with equity-focused strategies leading the way at 1.7%. Year-to-date returns are now approaching 10%, boosted by strong global macro and fixed-income arbitrage strategies. Larger funds with over $1 billion under management saw the highest returns, while net inflows of $2.3 billion show continued investor confidence. Despite market volatility, hedge funds across the Americas and Europe performed well, maintaining steady growth and attracting new investments.

### Asset Managers Eye $10 Trillion Opportunity

Asset managers are [gearing](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/09/18/mckinsey-says-finance-industry-shakeup-to-dislodge-10-trillion/) up for a $10 trillion influx of capital into the US market over the next decade, according to McKinsey & Co. This massive opportunity comes as banks, insurers, and wealthy clients look for investment solutions. However, many managers are facing revenue pressures as investors move away from high-fee products. To stay competitive, firms are focusing on private credit, insurance, and wealth management to capture a share of this growing pie. While the competition is fierce, the industry is optimistic about expanding its reach beyond traditional assets.

### Brazil Hedge Funds Diverge from Wall Street

Despite Wall Street’s [bullish](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/commodities/2024/09/18/hedge-funds-shun-the-brazil-trade-winning-fans-in-wall-street/) stance on Brazil, local hedge funds are taking a different view. Funds like Verde Asset Management and Ibiuna Investimentos remain skeptical of the country's fiscal outlook and are betting against interest-rate futures. Brazil’s government spending under President Lula da Silva is raising concerns about inflation and fiscal sustainability. While international banks like Barclays and UBS see opportunities, local investors are more cautious, citing risks from ongoing fiscal challenges and economic instability. Brazil’s markets have struggled this year, making the situation even more precarious.
