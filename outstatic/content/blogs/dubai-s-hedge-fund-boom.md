### Dubai Fast-Tracks Hedge Fund Growth

![Dubai Fast-Tracks Hedge Fund Growth](/images/27th-sept--dubais-hedge-fund-boom--omers-europe-exit--elliott-eyes-southwest-ceo-a-A4OT.webp)

Dubai is stepping up its game by [launching](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/09/26/dubai-seeks-to-fast-track-hedge-fund-boom-with-new-platform/) a new platform for hedge funds and investment companies to start operations faster. Capricorn Fund Managers Ltd., based in London, is introducing a regulatory hosting platform at the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This service allows fund managers to operate under Capricorn’s license, cutting costs and administrative hassles. Dubai’s low taxes and strategic location are attracting hedge funds, with firms like Millennium Management and Balyasny already expanding there. The city’s hedge fund industry now employs over 1,000 people, solidifying Dubai as a top global financial hub.

### Private Equity Chief Invests in York City FC

Bill E Ford, the CEO of private equity giant General Atlantic, has made a [move](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/26/american-private-equity-chiefs-family-buys-into-york-city-football-club/) into English football. His family office acquired a 24% stake in York City Football Club, a National League team, earlier this year. While the Uggla family, who also have deep ties to private equity, hold a majority, Ford’s involvement adds another American investor to lower-league English football. This trend mirrors the high-profile acquisition of Wrexham AFC by Hollywood stars. York City is off to a strong start this season, hoping to regain stability after financial struggles.

### Omers Halts Direct Private Equity in Europe

Canadian pension fund Omers is [shifting](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/26/omers-to-stop-making-direct-private-equity-investments-in-europe/) its private equity strategy in Europe. Instead of making direct investments, Omers will now partner with third-party managers. This change follows the departure of Jonathan Mussellwhite, who led European PE since 2018. The move comes amid a broader overhaul of Omers' global investment approach, focusing on diversifying its private equity portfolio. With C$133.6 billion in assets, the pension giant remains a key player in the global private equity space.

### Platinum Rejects Regal's Takeover Bid

Sydney-based Platinum Asset Management has [turned down](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/26/platinum-rejects-hedge-fund-regals-bid-says-open-to-talks/) a takeover offer from rival hedge fund Regal Partners. The board believes the A$526 million ($359 million) bid undervalues the company but remains open to other offers. While Regal has been actively growing its asset base through deals, Platinum has faced declining profits and outflows. Regal has successfully expanded its funds under management, now totaling A$17 billion, but Platinum’s board thinks there’s room for better opportunities.

### Elliott Pushes for Southwest CEO Ouster

![Elliott Pushes for Southwest CEO Ouster](/images/27th-sept--dubais-hedge-fund-boom--omers-europe-exit--elliott-eyes-southwest-ceo-b-A4ND.webp)

Activist investor Elliott Investment Management is [ramping up](https://www.hedgeweek.com/elliott-eyes-special-shareholder-meeting-in-bid-to-oust-southwest-ceo/#:~:text=Activist%20investor%20Elliott%20Investment%20Management,Bob%20Jordan%2C%20according%20to%20a) efforts to replace Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan. With a 10% stake in the company, Elliott plans to call a special shareholder meeting to push for leadership changes, accusing Jordan of underperformance. Despite this, Southwest's board still backs Jordan, seeing him as crucial for improving the airline’s financial results. The company is set to unveil its turnaround strategy soon, and Elliott's move seems like an attempt to disrupt this. Southwest has had a tough time since the pandemic, lagging behind competitors like Delta and United.

### Hedge Funds Miss Out on Vistra Surge

Hedge funds have largely [missed](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-largely-miss-out-on-vistra-share-price-surge/#:~:text=According%20to%20data%20from%20SEI,was%20131%20hedge%20fund%20owners.) out on the 192% year-to-date stock surge of Vistra Corp, an electricity and power generation company. While Vistra's gains have outpaced tech giant Nvidia's 144% rise, it hasn’t caught the eye of many hedge funds. Firms like Lone Pine, Third Point, and Coatue are among the few that benefited. Vistra may be under the radar, but with its strong performance, it’s becoming a quiet winner for those who saw the opportunity. Meanwhile, Nvidia remains a more popular choice, with nearly 300 hedge funds holding positions.

### Elliott Buys $450M Miami Office Tower

Elliott Investment Management just [added](https://www.hedgeweek.com/elliott-adds-to-south-florida-investments-with-450m-office-tower-acquisition/#:~:text=Paul%20Singer%27s%20Elliott%20Investment%20Management,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.) another major asset to its South Florida portfolio, purchasing the 701 Brickell office tower in Miami for around $450 million. Originally built in 1985 and renovated in 2021, the 33-story tower is over 90% leased with tenants like Bank of America and IT firm Kaseya. Elliott has been making waves in South Florida, both in real estate and through Tyko Capital, which backs major projects in the area. With this latest move, Elliott continues to strengthen its footprint in Miami’s booming real estate market.
