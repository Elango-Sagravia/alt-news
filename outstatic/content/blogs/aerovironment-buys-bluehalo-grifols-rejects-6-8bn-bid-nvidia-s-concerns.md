### AeroVironment acquires BlueHalo in $4.1bn deal

![](/images/aerovironment-to-acquire-arlington-capital-s-space-tech-bluehalo-in--4.1bn-deal--1--g2MT.jpg)

Drone maker AeroVironment is[ buying](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/aerovironment-to-acquire-arlington-capitals-space-tech-bluehalo-in-4-1bn-deal/#:~:text=Drone%20manufacturer%20AeroVironment%20is%20to,to%20a%20report%20by%20Reuters.) BlueHalo, a defense and space tech firm owned by Arlington Capital, in a $4.1 billion all-stock deal. AeroVironment will issue 18.5 million shares, giving its shareholders 60.5% ownership of the merged company. BlueHalo specializes in Counter-UAS and laser communication systems, which align with AeroVironment's diversification goals amid rising security needs. Post-merger, AeroVironment’s CEO Wahid Nawabi will lead, while BlueHalo's CEO transitions to an advisory role. Despite AeroVironment’s stock surging 56% this year, shares dipped 3.6% after the news. The deal, set to finalize by mid-2025, strengthens AeroVironment’s foothold in critical defense and space tech sectors.

### Grifols rejects Brookfield’s $6.8bn bid

![](/images/grifols-rejects-brookfield-s--undervalued--6.8bn-bid-QxMz.webp)

Spanish pharma giant Grifols[ turned down](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/grifols-rejects-brookfields-undervalued-6-8bn-bid/) Brookfield's €6.45 billion ($6.8 billion) takeover offer, calling it undervalued. Grifols, known for plasma-based therapies, believes the bid ignores its growth potential and strategic goals. Brookfield’s non-binding offer included €10.50 per A share and €7.62 per B share. Grifols urged shareholders to hold their stakes, emphasizing its financial strength and future trajectory. The stock, already down 30% this year, slid further after the announcement. Adding drama, Spain’s High Court is investigating short-seller Gotham City Research, which accused Grifols of financial misreporting—a claim Grifols denies. Brookfield had aimed to privatize Grifols for a strategic overhaul, but the board remained firm against the offer.

### CHART

**Profits of major oil companies are projected to reach the lowest point in three years**

![](/images/big-oil-I5OD.webp)

Big Oil's profits are expected to decline to their lowest levels in three years, with Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, TotalEnergies, and BP forecasted to post a 12% profit drop from the previous quarter. This decline reflects a challenging environment, where free cash flow is projected to be 30% lower than a year ago. Except for Shell, these companies are anticipated to struggle in covering dividends and share buybacks with available cash.

Share repurchases have been a key strategy for these oil majors, particularly after the post-COVID commodities rally, which generated record profits and attracted investors favoring payouts over a fast energy transition. However, with cash reserves shrinking, the sustainability of payout commitments made during prosperous times is under strain. The profit squeeze highlights growing pressures on the sector, balancing shareholder returns and financial flexibility amidst volatile energy markets and long-term transition challenges.

### BRIEFS

**Private Equity**

**→ Australia’s wealth fund shifts focus locally:** Australia’s Future Fund,[ valued](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/20/australias-wealth-fund-told-to-invest-more-in-domestic-assets/) at A$230 billion, now has a new mandate to invest more in local housing, energy, and infrastructure. This change aligns with the country’s goals to tackle structural shifts like net-zero transitions and demographic changes. By 2032, the fund is expected to reach A$380 billion, as withdrawals are paused until then. The primary focus remains on maximizing returns, targeting 4-5% above inflation. With a portfolio of 40% equities and 10% in infrastructure, the fund is well-positioned to balance national priorities with solid returns.

**→ Arc launches AI platform for private credit:** Fintech startup Arc[ unveiled](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/arc-launches-ai-platform-for-private-credit-market/) “AI Private Credit Analyst,” a groundbreaking tool for streamlining credit analysis in the private credit market. The AI-driven platform processes unstructured financial data to create detailed credit memos in minutes, slashing tasks that typically take weeks. With the private credit market expected to hit $2.8 trillion by 2028, Arc's solution improves underwriting speed and precision. Already used by 150 lenders, it’s expanding to more in 2025. By automating data-heavy processes, Arc helps lenders evaluate opportunities faster and more accurately.

**Hedge Funds**

**→ Hedge fund ideas light up Sohn London:** At the Sohn London Conference, fund managers[ shared](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/20/hedge-funds-pitch-short-activist-and-long-bets-at-sohn-london/) bold ideas. Highlights included Carson Block shorting Elf Beauty over revenue concerns. Spotify’s potential price hikes drew long interest. Activist bets on Vivendi and YouGov also featured.

**→ Effissimo stakes claim in Nissan:** Effissimo Capital’s 2.5% stake in Nissan Motor[ sparked](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/20/hedge-fund-effissimo-stirs-speculation-with-its-stake-in-nissan/) speculation as shares soared 13%, the biggest jump in 15 years. Analysts suggest Effissimo sees Nissan’s stock, trading at 0.25 times book value, as a deep value play. Others believe the hedge fund may pressure Nissan to buy out minority shareholders in Nissan Shatai, where Effissimo owns 30%. Known for its activism, including Toshiba, Effissimo’s silence on its intentions leaves the market guessing. Meanwhile, Nissan’s restructuring and stock recovery efforts may align with Effissimo’s potential strategy.

**→ EU bonds spotlighted as undervalued gem:** Diego Megia of Taula Capital sees EU bonds as a[ rare](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/20/hedge-fund-manager-diego-megia-says-eu-bonds-are-an-opportunity/) opportunity. Despite setbacks in reclassification as sovereign debt, the bonds’ low valuation offers potential for 40-basis-point spread narrowing if included in major indexes. Megia’s firm, launched with $5 billion, focuses on macro and fixed-income strategies. While MSCI and ICE declined reclassification, Bloomberg is still considering it. The bonds’ appeal lies in their relative cheapness compared to similarly rated sovereigns, making them an attractive play in the current market environment.

**Venture Capital**

**→ Aquaria secures $112M to innovate water:** Aquaria, a company creating water solutions from atmospheric sources,[ raised](https://vcnewsdaily.com/aquaria/venture-capital-funding/fhmnvwvhtv) $112 million to expand globally. Investors include Mistletoe and Soma Capital, with Upwell Water providing $100 million for deployment. The funds will support sustainable water projects and extend Aquaria’s footprint into new regions. Focused on addressing global water scarcity, Aquaria’s innovations aim to revolutionise water infrastructure. By turning “water from the sky” into a scalable solution, the company targets critical needs in water access and sustainable living.

**→ Federato’s AI transforms insurance underwriting:** Federato, an AI-driven insurance platform,[ raised](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/federato-fixes-insurance-risk-analysis-with-ai-raises-40m/) $40 million to optimize underwriting. Backed by StepStone Group and others, the platform processes massive datasets to speed up risk analysis and improve accuracy. Its RiskOps tool slashes “time to quote” by 90%, enhancing insurers’ ability to evaluate risks. Initially focused on wildfire modeling, Federato’s AI now supports larger players like Nationwide. The startup’s growth reflects the increasing demand for AI solutions in insurance, a trillion-dollar industry poised for transformative tech-driven efficiency.

**Others**

**→ Nvidia growth tempered by supply issues:** Nvidia forecasted Q4 revenue of $37.5 billion. Although the analyst estimate for Q4 revenue was $37.1 billion, some forecasts[ ranged](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/20/nvidia-forecast-fails-to-meet-the-loftiest-estimates-for-ai-star/) as high as $41 billion. Despite doubling sales this year, the AI chip giant faces supply constraints for its new Blackwell chips. Shares dipped 2% post-announcement, highlighting market sensitivity to Nvidia’s ability to meet demand. CEO Jensen Huang remains optimistic, citing surging demand for AI infrastructure. However, dependency on cloud giants and production challenges underline concerns. While Nvidia’s growth has been stellar, execution in 2025 will be key to sustaining its lead.

**→ OTPP partners with Nordic Capital for Max Matthiessen:** Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan[ acquired](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/20/canadas-otpp-to-co-own-max-matthiessen-with-nordic-capital/) a 50% stake in Max Matthiessen, valuing it at €1 billion. The deal with Nordic Capital, which retains co-ownership, strengthens OTPP’s foothold in financial services. Max Matthiessen, with over 800 employees, provides insurance, pensions, and wealth management solutions. OTPP plans organic growth through cross-selling and acquisitions, eyeing international expansion in Nordic regions.

### FOUNDATIONS

**How do stock buybacks impact a company’s value and shareholder wealth?**

![](/images/how-do-stock-buybacks-impact-a-company-s-value-and-shareholder-wealth-QxOT.webp)

Stock buybacks, or share repurchases, occur when a company buys back its own shares from the market, reducing the total number of shares outstanding. This can increase a company’s earnings per share (EPS) by distributing profits across fewer shares, often leading to higher stock prices. For shareholders, buybacks can enhance wealth by boosting share value and may offer a tax-efficient alternative to dividends, as capital gains are typically taxed less than dividends. Buybacks signal confidence from management, suggesting they believe the stock is undervalued and a good investment.

However, buybacks can also be controversial; critics argue that companies sometimes prioritize buybacks over investing in growth, potentially limiting long-term value. Additionally, if funded by debt, buybacks can increase a company’s financial risk. Overall, buybacks can positively impact shareholder wealth if they are part of a balanced strategy focused on sustainable growth.

### WHAT IS

**Sharpe Ratio**\
The Sharpe ratio shows how well an investment performs relative to its risk. It’s calculated by dividing the investment’s return by its volatility (how much it swings up and down). A higher Sharpe ratio means better returns for the amount of risk taken.
