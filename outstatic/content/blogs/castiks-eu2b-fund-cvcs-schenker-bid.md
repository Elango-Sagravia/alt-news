Alpha Partners has [raised](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/09/alpha-partners-raises-153m-third-fund-for-pro-rata-investments/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACsCsxtqsGJKONevgV3gVLR_e_ZQmdDn8lMx2njnCT5XpqcUeSkFBXAKhE_T4GpDr8mADJHVX0KzbfuGtlpVivuLixJ7yHNjVuS_6y5WKa3SOtEhrlOr4KCndRSkVyjf73a1R4BwW6XoifBlQpk2OQ1we6GVvZiLeHNrILLiR4nk) $153 million for its third fund, focusing on helping early-stage VCs maintain their ownership in promising companies. The fund, nearly three times bigger than its predecessor, invests alongside seed-stage VCs into companies raising Series B or later. Alpha typically invests $5 million to $10 million in companies with more than $10 million in revenue, growing at 50% annually. Recent investments include defense tech startups Shield AI and Rad AI. Alpha's exits include Coursera and Udemy, with a 20x return on Coupang's Series G and F.

### CVC's Bid for DB Schenker Explained

CVC Capital Partners is [trying](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/09/cvc-presses-case-for-schenker-bid-with-deutsche-bahn-officials/) to outbid rival DSV for Deutsche Bahn's logistics unit, DB Schenker, worth over €14 billion. In a letter to Deutsche Bahn, CVC proposed that the company could reinvest €1 billion and still make €2 billion to €2.5 billion when CVC exits. The alternative offer is reportedly supported by employee representatives and follows a similar model to CVC's investment in Evonik. While DSV is favored for its higher upfront offer, CVC believes its reinvestment option could bring more long-term value to Deutsche Bahn.

### KKR Eyes Industrial Infrastructure as 'Next Big Thing'

KKR's Raj Agrawal [believes](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/09/kkrs-agrawal-calls-industrial-infrastructure-next-big-thing/) industrial infrastructure, like storage facilities and logistics, is the next hot asset class. Fortune 500 companies own a lot of these assets but don't need to, which opens the door for KKR to swoop in. Digital infrastructure, like data centers, and the energy transition are also KKR's big bets, with $8 billion invested in the past year. Agrawal sees a $100 trillion opportunity through 2040. KKR's infrastructure business has doubled its assets under management in just three years, now standing at around $75 billion.

### Hedge Funds Cash In on China's Dollar Bet

![Hedge Funds](/images/10th-sept--castik-s--2b-fund--cvc-s-schenker-bid--kkr-s-infrastructure-bet-b-kxMT.webp)

Hedge funds have been [profiting](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-profit-from-chinas-100bn-bet-against-the-dollar/) from China's $100 billion currency bet against the dollar, thanks to a strategy involving foreign exchange swaps. Chinese state banks have been using these swaps to support the yuan without tapping into the central bank's reserves. While this has helped stabilize the currency, hedge funds on the other side of these trades have been earning near risk-free returns of up to 6%. However, Chinese banks have faced paper losses ranging from $5 billion to $16 billion due to the yuan's drop earlier this year.

### Davidson Kempner Shuts Distressed Fund

Davidson Kempner is [shutting](https://www.hedgeweek.com/davidson-kempner-to-shut-distressed-opportunities-fund-amid-challenging-market-conditions/#:~:text=New%20York%2Dheadquartered%20global%20hedge,to%20a%20report%20by%20Reuters.) down its $2 billion Distressed Opportunities Fund despite positive returns of 5% for the year. The hedge fund firm, which manages $38 billion, cited a challenging environment for distressed investing as the reason. Low interest rates and weakened covenants have decreased corporate default rates, making distressed opportunities harder to find. Davidson Kempner will now focus on credit markets, such as corporate bonds and structured deals, which it believes offer better potential. The lead managers of the Distressed Opportunities Fund will stay with the firm.

### Former Point72 President Cancels Hedge Fund Launch

Douglas Haynes, former president of Point72, has [scrapped](https://www.hedgeweek.com/ex-point72-president-scraps-hedge-fund-launch-plan/) plans to launch his hedge fund, Norias Research Group. Haynes struggled to secure enough initial investors to move forward with the fund despite assembling a 30-person team and developing trading infrastructure. The fund aimed to capitalize on analyst-driven investment ideas rather than costly portfolio managers. A letter to potential clients revealed the decision to halt the launch due to an insufficient base of day-one investors.

### Atomico Raises $1.24B for Startups

Atomico, one of Europe's top venture capital firms, has [closed](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/08/european-vc-atomico-closes-1-24b-across-two-funds-for-early-and-growth-stage-startups/) $1.24 billion across two funds to back early- and growth-stage startups. The firm raised $485 million for Series A-stage companies and $754 million for later-stage startups. This marks Atomico's largest fundraising to date, although it fell short of its target for early-stage investments. The move highlights a trend among VCs to focus more on scaling startups rather than fledgling companies, particularly in Europe, where VC funding has been hit hard by global economic uncertainties.
