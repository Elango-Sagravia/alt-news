### Hedge Funds Bet Big on Rising Yen

Hedge funds are doubling down on the yen’s recent strength, which has [surged](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-up-bets-on-yen-rally/) 14% against the US dollar since June. With the Bank of Japan signaling potential rate hikes, traders are taking positions against currencies like the Australian dollar and Swiss franc. Analysts predict that if the BOJ hints at more hikes, the yen could hit 135 by year-end. The upcoming BOJ and Federal Reserve meetings will play a big role in the yen's future movements. Hedge funds are keeping a close eye, positioning themselves to benefit from this currency shift.
