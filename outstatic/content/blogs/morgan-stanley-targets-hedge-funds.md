Elliott Investment Management has [reached a 10% ownership](https://www.hedgeweek.com/elliott-has-power-to-call-southwest-airlines-special-meeting-after-reaching-10-stock-threshold/) threshold in Southwest Airlines, allowing it to call a special meeting.

![Morgan Stanley targets hedge funds, Newspring invests in hotels](/images/4th-sept--morgan-stanley-targets-hedge-funds--newspring-invests-in-hotels-b--1--YxNj.webp)

Morgan Stanley is [focusing on hedge funds](https://www.hedgeweek.com/morgan-stanley-targets-hedge-funds-in-bid-to-reclaim-stock-trading-top-spot/#:~:text=Morgan%20Stanley%20is%20targeting%20hedge,report%20by%20the%20Financial%20Times.) as part of its effort to regain its position as the top stock trading firm, a title it lost to Goldman Sachs after the Archegos collapse. Under the leadership of new CEO Ted Pick, the bank has narrowed the gap with Goldman, reporting strong equities trading revenues. Morgan Stanley is renewing its efforts to attract both quantitative and traditional equity hedge funds by offering more credit and leveraging its technology investments. This strategy aims to reestablish Morgan Stanley as a leader in the equities market.

### Hedge Funds Step Into Deal Hedges

Hedge funds are increasingly participating in [deal contingent hedges](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-fuel-secondary-market-for-deal-contingent-hedges/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20are%20increasingly%20stepping,to%20a%20report%20by%20IFR.), helping banks manage risks during mergers and acquisitions. This involvement is creating a secondary market for these derivatives, allowing banks to underwrite larger transactions. As demand for deal contingent hedges rises, particularly from private equity firms, hedge funds are finding new revenue opportunities by taking on these risks. This trend is significant as it enables banks to handle more complex and larger deals by offloading some risk to hedge funds.

### MFA Calls for Flexible Credit Risk Rules

The Managed Funds Association (MFA) is urging the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to [adopt more flexible guidelines](https://www.hedgeweek.com/mfa-encourages-bcbs-to-adopt-flexible-frisk-based-ccr-management-guidelines/) on counterparty credit risk (CCR) management. The MFA argues that the current proposed guidelines are too rigid and do not account for the diverse risk management practices of banks, particularly when dealing with private funds. The association believes that a one-size-fits-all approach could hinder investment strategies and economic growth. MFA's letter recommends a more tailored framework that better aligns with individual counterparty risks.
