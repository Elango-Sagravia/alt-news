Hedge fund DE Shaw has taken a [$108 million short position](https://www.hedgeweek.com/de-shaw-makes-108m-bayer-short-bet/) on Bayer, following a recent earnings report that sent the pharma giant’s shares tumbling to a two-decade low. CEO Bill Anderson warned of further earnings declines, especially in agricultural markets, compounding challenges for Bayer as it pursues a turnaround. DE Shaw’s bet reflects investor skepticism over Bayer’s prospects in the near term, highlighting the pressure on Anderson’s strategy to revive the company’s performance.

### BRIEFS

**Private equity**

**→ Family offices bet big on secondary sales:** Family offices are investing heavily in secondary sales, a market valued at [$140 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-14/family-offices-flock-to-140-billion-market-for-secondary-sales?embedded-checkout=true) this year. As liquidity challenges rise, these wealthy investors see secondaries as a way to acquire stakes in mature private companies at discounted rates. JPMorgan notes strong client interest in this area, with prominent family offices like Chicago’s Mills dynasty and France’s Pinault family participating. With rising rates curbing fresh capital and hence liquidity, secondary sales are an alternative for investors seeking established assets.

Its upcoming infrastructure funds, DIF VIII and Value Add IV, are set for release in the first half of next year.

The sale attracted both local and international institutional investors, showing the appeal of Saudi’s capital market and the demand for STC shares.

### FOUNDATIONS

**What is the January effect?**

![The January Effect is a market trend where small-cap stocks rise in January](/images/what-is-the-january-effect_-Q4MD.webp)

The January Effect is a market phenomenon where stock prices, particularly those of small-cap companies, tend to rise in January. This trend is attributed to various factors, with tax-loss harvesting being a major driver. At year-end, investors often sell losing stocks to offset capital gains and reduce taxable income. This selling pressure in December can depress stock prices, especially for smaller, less-liquid stocks. In January, as investors rebuy stocks they previously sold or seek new investments, demand pushes prices back up.

Another contributing factor is the influx of new capital at the start of the year, such as from year-end bonuses and institutional fund rebalancing. While the January Effect is well-known, it doesn’t occur consistently and has weakened over time due to increased awareness and market efficiency.

### FUN FRIDAYS

**Movie Recommendation: Margin Call**

!["Margin Call" is a tense financial thriller unraveling corporate greed and moral dilemmas during the 2008 crisis as bankers confront a looming disaster](/images/margin-call-7-2-IyND.webp)

Margin Call is a gripping financial thriller that dives into the high-stakes world of investment banking during the 2008 financial crisis. As junior analysts uncover a catastrophic flaw in the firm's trading algorithm, the plot exposes how layers of debt and reckless risk-taking created a ticking time bomb.

It captures a tense 24-hour period where loyalty, greed, and moral dilemmas collide as executives scramble to salvage their fortunes. More than just a crisis drama, Margin Call is a fascinating character study that reflects the pressures and decisions shaping modern finance.

### WHAT IS

**Assets Under Management (AUM)**\
\
AUM is the total value of all the investments a financial firm or mutual fund manages for its clients. If you give $1,000 to a fund manager to invest for you, that $1,000 is part of their AUM. It’s like the total “pot” of money they are responsible for managing.
