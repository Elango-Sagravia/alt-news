![Zeal Asset Management to close, returning $1.6 billion to investors as founders retire](/images/hong-kong-hedge-fund-zeal-to-shut--returning-1.6-billion-to-investors-YxNT.webp)

Hong Kong’s Zeal Asset Management is[ shutting down](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hong-kong-hedge-fund-zeal-asset-management-to-shut-and-return-1-6bn-to-investors/), planning to return over $1.6 billion to investors as its founders head for retirement. Focusing mainly on Chinese equities, Zeal faced challenges in recent years as China’s market downturn and geopolitical tensions hurt performance. The flagship Voyage China Fund, once boasting gains, declined significantly over recent years. Zeal’s founders cited a desire to retire, with an official wind-down expected by late 2025. The closure marks another setback for China-focused funds, which have struggled amid challenging market conditions.

![EQT’s $1.4 billion bid for OEM International gains 72.5% shareholder support](/images/sweden-s-eqt-launches-1.4-billion-bid-for-oem-international--EwOT.webp)

Swedish private equity group EQT has made a[ $1.4 billion bid](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/05/swedens-eqt-makes-14-billion-cash-offer-for-oem-international/) for OEM International, securing 72.5% of votes thanks to support from OEM’s key shareholders. However, some committee members advised against accepting, citing unfair financial terms. EQT’s offer comes amid stock market turbulence, with shares dropping 10% upon announcement. If EQT reaches 90% control, it could force a delisting.

### Hedge Funds Hit by European Market Dip

European-focused hedge funds[ took a hit](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-hit-hard-by-european-stock-market-october-declines/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20concentrated%20on%20European,brokerage%20division%20at%20Goldman%20Sachs.) in October, logging their biggest losses in over a year due to a stock sell-off. The STOXX Europe 600 Index fell by 3.6%, with disappointing performances from industrial and energy sectors. Although banks and biotech fared well, falling prices led hedge funds to shift strategies, focusing more on financial stocks while reducing leverage. Utilities and tech, especially semiconductor and defense stocks, saw the most selling. Compared to US funds, European traders’ year-to-date returns dropped to 5%, nearly half of the US benchmark's 11.5%.

### Coatue Raises $1bn for AI Investments

Coatue Management, aiming to[ fuel](https://www.hedgeweek.com/coatue-targets-1bn-to-up-flagship-fund-ai-and-tech-innovation-bets/) its AI and tech investments, is raising $1 billion for its flagship fund. Partnering with Raymond James for this capital round, Coatue is set to tap into both institutional and high-net-worth investors. This is the first such initiative in years for Coatue, which manages nearly $50 billion. The fund's AI focus aligns with founder Philippe Laffont’s belief in the tech's growth potential across industries. Coatue’s hedge fund has already gained nearly 15% this year, showing strong performance in both public and private markets.

### Digital Assets Hit $29.2bn Inflows YTD

Digital asset funds hit a[ record](https://www.hedgeweek.com/digital-assets-funds-hit-record-breaking-29-2bn-ytd/#:~:text=Digital%20asset%20investment%20products%20saw,minor%20inflows%20of%20%245.1m.) $29.2 billion in inflows for 2024, with $2.2 billion coming in just last week, driven mainly by Bitcoin. The recent surge is linked to US optimism around a potential Republican win. Bitcoin saw the lion's share, although short positions and Ethereum also attracted interest. This year’s inflows pushed total assets under management to over $100 billion for the second time, last seen in June. Ethereum and Solana are also gaining traction, showing that investors remain keen on crypto even with the market’s volatility.

### Regulators Consider Basis Trade Probes

With hedge fund bets on US Treasuries[ reaching](https://www.hedgeweek.com/regulators-weigh-basis-trade-investigation-amid-record-bets/#:~:text=The%20recent%20record%20level%20of,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.) $1.15 trillion, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is considering a probe into the strategy called basis trading. This method capitalizes on slight price differences between Treasuries and their futures, raising regulatory concerns about market stability. The FSB has struggled to oversee shadow banking broadly, so a focused approach may yield clearer results. Private markets, with their high valuations and leverage, are also under watch.

### Ex-Segantii Staff Join New Hedge Funds

Following Segantii Capital’s collapse, many ex-staff have quickly[ moved](https://www.hedgeweek.com/ex-segantii-employees-find-new-roles-at-jain-global-and-bluecrest/) to new roles. Jain Global and BlueCrest are among the most active in hiring these experienced professionals. Notable hires include Sung Kim and Ivan Cajic, bringing strong quantitative and index strategy expertise. Jain Global’s aggressive recruitment follows a recent $5.3 billion fundraising round, while BlueCrest expanded its London tech team. Both firms are counting on Segantii’s former talent to boost performance, highlighting the fast-paced shifts within hedge fund careers and the demand for specialized expertise

### Hedge Funds Adjust Dollar Bets Ahead of Election

With the US election near, hedge funds are[ reassessing](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-rethink-dollar-bets-on-eve-of-us-election/) dollar positions. A possible win by Democratic candidate Kamala Harris could weaken the dollar, prompting funds to buy euro and Australian dollar options. In contrast, a Trump victory could strengthen the dollar. This uncertainty led to the largest dollar index drop since August. Leveraged funds are increasingly hedging with currency options, betting on volatility as polling data indicates a close race. Currency markets reflect these shifts, showing an active response to the evolving election landscape.

### KKR Gains Control in Fuji Soft Takeover

KKR has[ secured](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/11/05/kkr-gets-over-third-of-fuji-soft-after-tender-offer-first-stage/) over one-third of Fuji Soft’s shares after completing the first stage of a tender offer, edging closer to a full takeover. Minority shareholders, including major investors like 3D Investment Partners, tendered shares to KKR, which had initially received a competing offer from Bain Capital. KKR’s bid, however, was favored for its certainty, with Fuji Soft aligning on a buyout strategy. This win highlights KKR’s steady expansion in Japan, reflecting a broader trend of private equity interest in strategic technology acquisitions across Asia.

### Sandglass Capital Bets on Distressed Debt Gains

Sandglass Capital Advisors is eyeing [more gains](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/05/hedge-fund-that-tops-em-rankings-sees-more-distressed-debt-gains/) in emerging markets' distressed debt, particularly in Argentina, Ukraine, and Ecuador. The hedge fund, among the top performers in this niche, sees opportunities in these high-yield bonds amid potential US rate cuts. Argentina’s bonds, for example, could yield 30-40% returns if reforms succeed. The firm also finds value in corporates that managed to refinance debt during lower-rate periods, especially in telecom and airlines across Latin America and Eastern Europe. Emerging market volatility remains high, but Sandglass believes in lucrative opportunities within this space.
