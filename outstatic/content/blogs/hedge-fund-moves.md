The Brown Divest Coalition is pushing for the school to exit holdings in companies like Boeing and Northrop Grumman.

Australian lithium miner Pilbara Minerals is cutting back on expansion projects after an 89% drop in net income due to falling lithium prices. The company is reducing capital expenditure and pausing new projects, including its Salinas mine in Brazil until the market recovers. Lithium prices have plunged by 70% as EV sales slow and supply increases, leading to oversupply concerns. Despite the challenges, Pilbara remains a potential takeover target, though no suitors have emerged yet. The company’s cautious approach reflects the broader struggles in the lithium market.
