### Asset-Backed Securities for Data Centers Rise

![DoubleLine Capital sees growth in data center asset-backed securities as digital demand surges](/images/doubleline-wantes-to-buy-asset-backed-data-center-assets-U0Nz.webp)

With digital demand[ booming](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/10/29/doubleline-sees-compelling-case-to-buy-asset-backed-securities-tied-to-data-centers/), DoubleLine Capital sees big potential in asset-backed securities (ABS) tied to data centers. The ABS market for these facilities is small but growing, representing just 5% of data center investment, though DoubleLine expects that to increase. Major players like Blackstone have already jumped in, recently acquiring AirTrunk, a significant data center operator. Risks of overbuilding remain, but current demand still outweighs supply. As data needs continue expanding with digitalization, DoubleLine believes data centers backed by long-term, quality tenants are well-positioned for stable growth in the near term.

### Private Equity Backs Nuclear Power Growth

![Private equity’s next big bet is AI in nuclear energy](/images/pe-s-next-bet-is-on-ai-in-nuclear-energy-M4Mz.webp)

Private equity is taking a bet on nuclear power, aligning with tech companies’ massive energy needs driven by AI. Firms like Carlyle and Apollo are[ exploring ways](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-29/private-equity-s-next-bet-on-artificial-intelligence-is-nuclear-energy?embedded-checkout=true) to finance nuclear plants, while Brookfield is expanding its stake. Microsoft and Amazon have inked power deals, with the revived Three Mile Island plant now back in operation. Nuclear promises stable returns and reliable energy, which appeals to private equity. Despite long timelines and regulatory hurdles, private capital is increasingly seeing nuclear as a viable investment, especially with demand rising as economies electrify and tech needs grow.

### Sequoia Scores Big on Crypto Sale

Sequoia Capital is[ poised](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/10/28/sequoia-to-rake-in-more-than-100-million-from-crypto-acquisition/) to make over $100 million from Stripe’s $1.1 billion acquisition of crypto startup Bridge. Sequoia’s 16% stake in Bridge paid off handsomely, especially considering their initial $19 million investment. Other big players like Ribbit and Index Ventures are also cashing in. Bridge, focused on stablecoins, grew rapidly, catching Stripe’s attention. This acquisition brings a glimmer of hope to the struggling crypto startup sector, where exits have been few due to market challenges. The deal is pending regulatory approval, signaling a rare win for venture capital amid a tough environment for crypto.

### Vantage Point Bets on Trump-Driven Gains

Vantage Point Asset Management is[ betting](https://www.hedgeweek.com/vantage-point-makes-trump-bet-with-us-dollar-and-japan-stock-wagers/) on a Trump win, investing in Japanese stocks and the US dollar. The Singapore-based firm’s strategy hinges on the idea that a Trump victory will drive global growth, benefiting Japan’s export-reliant economy. The yen has weakened against the dollar, and Vantage Point expects it could fall further. Their fund has outperformed, partly due to Japan’s high sensitivity to industrial production. Even if Trump doesn’t win, Vantage Point sees favorable conditions for Japanese equities, citing Japan’s strong industrial base and correlation with global economic trends.

### Private Equity’s Buying Spree Is Back

Private equity is back in action, closing in on[ $85 billion](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/10/29/private-equity-reopens-checkbook-for-85-billion-us-deal-spree/) in acquisitions of public US companies this year. Factors like unspent capital and a booming private credit market have made valuations more appealing for buyouts. Recently, software companies have been particularly attractive to private equity due to predictable revenue and high cash flow. Big names like KKR, Blackstone, and Silver Lake are leading the way, making 2024 a busy year for software M&A. As interest rates stabilize, the momentum in private equity deals looks set to carry into 2025, with more acquisitions on the horizon.

### Digital Asset Inflows Set New Record

Digital assets are seeing[ massive](https://www.hedgeweek.com/digital-assets-funds-ytd-inflows-hit-27bn/#:~:text=Digital%20asset%20inflows%20reached%20%24901,Flows%20Weekly%20Report%20from%20CoinShares.) inflows, hitting a record $27 billion year-to-date. Bitcoin led with $920 million, partly influenced by US political factors. Other digital assets, like Solana and blockchain equities, saw positive inflows, while Ethereum recorded some outflows. The rising interest in digital assets, despite market volatility, is notable as it outpaces previous years' records. This growing momentum showcases how digital assets are gaining mainstream traction, becoming a larger part of diversified portfolios, and establishing themselves as a significant investment class with continued inflow potential as 2024 progresses.

### Private Credit and Bank Debt Lines Blur

The private credit and bank debt sectors are merging, with firms like Apollo and Blackstone lending to established businesses in ways that make traditional banks nervous. Apollo's Marc Rowan predicts that, within 18 months, these lending options may seem indistinguishable for investment-grade borrowers. Citigroup’s recent [partnership](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/10/29/wall-street-sees-lines-blur-between-private-credit-and-bank-debt/) with Apollo, aiming to offer $25 billion in corporate financing, is a key example. Banks like Goldman Sachs are already pivoting, helping clients invest in private credit. This shift highlights how asset managers are encroaching on what was once big banks' turf, adapting to the evolving financial landscape.
