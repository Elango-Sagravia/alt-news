As pandemic-era valuations fade, nearly 30% of venture capital deals in the first half of 2024 were flat or down rounds, according to PitchBook’s Q2 2024 US VC Valuations Report. This marks a decade-high, with down rounds jumping from 7% in 2022 to 14% in 2023 and flat rounds rising from 4% to 10% over the same period. Investors now favor leaner startups with clear profit paths, leading many companies to accept lower valuations. High-profile startups like Ramp and Astranis have faced significant valuation cuts, with some managing partial recoveries while others struggle amid the ongoing market reset.
