![Alameda Research boss Caroline Ellison begins two-year sentence for FTX fraud](/images/alameda-boss-ellison-begins-two-year-sentence-over-ftx-fraud-QyND.webp)

Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research,[ started](https://www.hedgeweek.com/alameda-boss-ellison-begins-two-year-sentence-over-ftx-fraud/) her two-year sentence at Danbury Federal Correctional Institution on November 7, 2024. Inmate 36854-510, Ellison played a pivotal role in FTX’s $11 billion fraud, leading to the downfall of the $32 billion crypto exchange. Her cooperation, after a December 2022 plea deal, was key in convicting Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX's founder, who received a 25-year sentence for misuse of customer funds. Other FTX execs faced repercussions, including former engineering director Nishad Singh and co-CEO Ryan Salame, underscoring the vast impact of FTX’s collapse.

Brazilian hedge fund Verde Asset Management took a[ bold position](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/11/brazilian-hedge-fund-verde-says-it-made-bitcoin-bet-before-trump-win/) in Bitcoin ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential win.

Despite a recent minor dip, Verde has outperformed local Brazilian hedge fund benchmarks, making strategic moves across currencies and commodities for future growth.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why are tech stocks volatile in a high-interest-rate environment?**

![Why are tech stocks volatile in a high-interest-rate environment?](/images/why-are-tech-stocks-volatile-in-a-high-interest-rate-environment_-E1OD.webp)

Tech stocks are particularly volatile in a high-interest-rate environment because rising rates increase borrowing costs, impacting companies that rely on debt to fuel growth. Many tech companies, especially younger ones, depend on external financing to develop new products, invest in R&D, or expand operations. For instance, Meta’s significant investment in the metaverse required substantial capital, which becomes more expensive as interest rates climb, pressuring profit margins.

Additionally, tech stocks are often valued based on future earnings expectations. Investors use discounted cash flow models to determine these valuations, which are sensitive to interest rates. When rates go up, the discount rate applied to future earnings rises, making those future profits less attractive in today's terms. This can lead to a revaluation of stock prices, causing volatility. Moreover, higher returns from safer assets, like bonds, can draw investors away from riskier tech stocks, contributing further to price swings in the sector.

### WHAT IS

**Dividend Yield**

Dividend yield is a measure of how much a company pays its shareholders in dividends each year relative to its stock price. Think of it like the “interest rate” you earn for holding a company’s stock, expressed as a percentage. For example, if a company’s stock costs $100 and it pays $5 in dividends per year, the dividend yield is 5%.
