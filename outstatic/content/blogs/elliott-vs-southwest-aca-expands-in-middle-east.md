### Top China Quant Fund Shuts Neutral Strategy

Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management,[ managing](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/10/21/top-china-quant-winds-down-strategy-pummeled-by-market-rally/) $7 billion, is winding down its market-neutral products. A recent surge in Chinese stocks squeezed short positions, impacting their strategy. The firm’s shift to long-only strategies reflects confidence in China’s market. High-Flyer had been reducing these positions for two years, and the latest move won’t shake up the market much. This trend mirrors struggles in China’s 1.6 trillion-yuan quant industry, where quants faced margin calls as stock index futures surged. With 98% of its assets now long-only, High-Flyer has limited future returns for its market-neutral approach.

### BHP Faces £36 Billion Class Action in UK

BHP Group is headed to court in London over a class action lawsuit tied to the 2015[ Fundão Dam collapse](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/10/21/bhp-embroiled-in-36-billion-uk-class-action-over-brazil-dam-collapse/) in Brazil. Over 620,000 Brazilians are seeking £36 billion in damages. The disaster devastated local communities, polluted rivers, and claimed 19 lives. BHP argues it isn’t liable, as Samarco Mineracao, the joint venture with Vale, is independent. Settlement talks with Brazilian authorities are underway, potentially reducing the scope of the UK lawsuit. This trial tests whether English courts can hold multinational firms accountable for environmental disasters occurring abroad.

### ACA Expands with Effecta Compliance Group Acquisition

ACA Group, a governance, risk, and compliance solutions provider, has[ acquired](https://www.hedgeweek.com/aca-group-acquires-effect-compliance-group-in-bid-for-middle-east-expansion/) Effecta Compliance Group, a UK and UAE-based consultancy. The acquisition enhances ACA’s presence in the Middle East, where the regulatory landscape is rapidly expanding. In 2023, Dubai’s Financial Services Authority saw a record increase in applications, and licenses in Abu Dhabi rose significantly. Clare Curtis, founder of Effecta, will lead ACA’s UAE operations under the ACA Effecta brand. This move strengthens ACA’s global footprint, providing firms with broader support in navigating increasingly complex compliance requirements.

Activist hedge fund Elliott Investment Management has[ started](https://www.hedgeweek.com/activist-elliot-begins-settlement-talks-with-southwest-airlines/) settlement talks with Southwest Airlines, aiming to avoid a proxy fight over board control.

The fund previously called for a special shareholder meeting to replace eight directors and remove CEO Bob Jordan. Southwest is pushing back, citing concerns about disruption during a busy travel period. As negotiations continue, both parties are working toward a potential resolution, but a final deal is still pending.
