![Hedge funds leverage the Singapore dollar as a proxy for 2024 U.S. election bets](/images/hedge-funds-turn-to-sgd-to-make-us-election-bet--2--A5MD.webp)

Hedge funds are[ using](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/30/hedge-funds-turning-to-singapore-dollar-to-make-us-election-bets/) the Singapore dollar as a proxy to speculate on the 2024 U.S. election. Demand for call options on USD/SGD is near its highest since mid-2023, with traders positioning for a stronger dollar if Donald Trump wins. The Monetary Authority of Singapore’s currency approach makes the SGD attractive for macro wagers tied to global events. As speculation rises, hedge funds are also looking at other Asian currencies, including the yuan, to hedge potential tariff effects, reflecting growing interest in currency markets amid election uncertainty.

### Kyocera to Reduce KDDI Stake for Cash

Kyocera is[ selling](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/10/30/kyocera-plans-to-sell-down-kddi-stake-to-shore-up-its-finances/) part of its $10.4 billion stake in Japan’s telecom operator KDDI to strengthen its finances.

Branded as Thompson Mexico City Reforma Hotel & Residences, the tower includes 104 condos and 115 hotel suites, set for a $190 million sellout. Jon Paul Perez, president of Related Group, sees Mexico’s wealthy residents as key buyers following the success of previous Mexican developments.

Samsung’s stock has[ plunged](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2024/10/29/samsungs-sudden-122-billion-wipeout-shows-the-cost-of-sleeping-on-ai/) by 32% since July, losing $122 billion in market value due to delays in AI memory chips and struggles in catching up with TSMC in outsourced chipmaking. While Samsung once led the tech space, setbacks have seen competitors like SK Hynix and Nvidia excel. Investor confidence has wavered, with major funds reducing Samsung holdings, citing management and strategic challenges. Samsung’s recent management shake-up and expected Q3 results might signal further restructuring, but investors remain cautious as rivals continue gaining traction in AI-driven growth areas.

Funds managed by Citco recorded a YTD return of 11.03%, with medium-sized funds ($1bn–$3bn) outperforming with a 5.34% return.

Private equity professionals, who typically pay this lower rate on profits from asset sales, will see a moderate tax increase compared to the 45% income tax rate.

Chirico, terminated in 2024, denies knowledge of any fraud and claims he was also a victim. This lawsuit is part of a larger investigation, with the DOJ examining WaterStation’s operations. Jefferies aims to recover $5.3 million paid to Chirico, alleging he violated fiduciary responsibilities.

### Ex-Goldman Banker Takes on Korean Chaebol

Billionaire Michael Kim’s private equity firm MBK Partners is waging a [takeover battle](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/29/ex-goldman-banker-turned-pe-billionaire-takes-on-koreas-chaebol/) for Korea Zinc, challenging Korea’s powerful family-run chaebol system. MBK and partner Young Poong Corp. have invested heavily to acquire a 38% stake in Korea Zinc, the world’s largest zinc refiner. The takeover, backed by improved corporate governance aims, faces opposition from current management and Bain Capital. Kim, seen as a reform advocate, views Korea as a ‘value market,’ with chaebols offering the potential for substantial growth. This battle could reshape Korea’s corporate landscape by promoting shareholder-friendly practices.
