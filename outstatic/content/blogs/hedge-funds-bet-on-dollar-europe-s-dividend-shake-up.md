With over 200 million active users across its apps, Bending Spoons might be Europe’s next tech giant.

### Goldman Sachs Backs Aussie Real Estate Fund

Goldman Sachs just[ refinanced](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/10/28/goldman-refinances-a500-million-australia-property-credit-fund/) Pallas Capital's A$500 million fund in Australia. This fund targets mid-market companies struggling to get traditional financing, mainly supporting real estate projects with secured loans.

The fund’s average loan size ranges from A$2 million to A$20 million, giving mid-sized developers and property investors a boost in a tightening economy.

### Hedge Funds Bet Against the Yen

![Japan's yen faces hedge fund pressure amid political uncertainty, with rates near 153 yen per dollar](/images/hedge-funds-sold-yen-before-us-election-gzNz.webp)

Hedge funds recently flipped[ bearish](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/27/hedge-funds-sold-yen-just-before-election-catapulted-japan-risk/) on Japan’s yen, just as Japan’s ruling party failed to secure a majority. This surprise loss left Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in a tight spot, raising political uncertainty around Japan’s economy. Speculators are shorting the yen, expecting further declines, with rates now around 153 yen per dollar—near a three-month low. This bearish outlook could keep the yen under pressure, especially if the Japanese government doesn’t stabilize soon.

![Blackstone-backed Hipgnosis to issue $1.47 billion in music royalty bonds, backed by hits from Shakira and the Red Hot Chili Peppers](/images/hipgnosis-plans-1.47b-music-bond-sale-Q4OD.webp)

Blackstone-backed Hipgnosis is set to[ sell](https://www.investmentnews.com/alternatives/blackstone-owned-hipgnosis-plots-147b-music-bond-sale/257906#:~:text=Hipgnosis%2C%20a%20company%20that%20bought,Chili%20Peppers%20and%2050%20Cent.) $1.47 billion in bonds, all backed by royalties from big-name artists like Shakira and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This is the company’s second music royalty-backed bond sale, following a $221 million issue in 2022. Investors are betting on steady cash flows from over 45,000 songs, with most of them older hits. Hipgnosis was acquired by Blackstone after facing market challenges, and this bond issue is part of its plan to stabilize and grow.

### Millennium Eyes First New Fund in Decades

Millennium Management, one of the biggest names in multi-strategy hedge funds, is[ considering](https://www.hedgeweek.com/millennium-mulls-first-found-in-more-than-30-years/#:~:text=Multi%2Dstrategy%20hedge%20fund%20major,report%20by%20the%20Financial%20Times.) its first new fund since launching over 30 years ago. This fund would target less liquid investments, especially private credit, a fast-growing asset class. With banks tightening lending, private credit is attracting investor attention. Millennium has already grown to $69.5 billion in assets with solid returns, but a private credit fund would be a new direction. The firm might use its existing capital or raise new funds to kickstart this venture, though no final decision has been made.

### Robinhood Adds Election Event Contracts

Robinhood just[ launched](https://www.investmentnews.com/alternatives/robinhood-wades-into-event-trading-with-harris-and-trump-contracts/257923) event trading contracts, starting with the upcoming U.S. presidential election. This new offering lets users bet on the election outcome between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, giving retail investors a way to profit from political predictions. It’s part of a broader push by Robinhood to diversify its services and offer more ways to trade, following court rulings that have greenlighted event-based trading in the U.S. It’s a unique, high-stakes addition, though critics warn of potential risks, like market manipulation, in this growing sector.

### Hedge Funds Boost Dollar Positions

Hedge funds and asset managers have gone[ bullish](https://www.hedgeweek.com/investors-flip-to-bullish-dollar-bets/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%2C%20asset%20managers%2C%20and,Trading%20Commission%20compiled%20by%20Bloomberg.) on the U.S. dollar, taking long positions totaling about $9.2 billion. This shift comes as strong economic data and the upcoming election make the dollar look like a safe bet. October has seen a 3.2% rise in the dollar index, its best month in two years. With currencies like the yen and euro facing more risk, traders are piling into dollar positions as they prep for potential market volatility.

### Hedge Funds Reshape European Dividends Market

European dividends are seeing[ more action](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-wield-growing-influence-in-european-dividend-market/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20are%20increasingly%20shaping,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.) from hedge funds. In the past, these markets were driven mainly by structured products, but now multi-strategy hedge funds are actively trading Euro Stoxx 50 dividend futures. This shift has decreased market volatility and brought stability, as hedge funds rely less on traditional dividend products and lean more on fixed-income derivatives. With higher interest rates, we’re seeing a new landscape emerge in European dividend trading. Analysts expect fewer dramatic market shifts in the future, pointing to a maturing market structure.
