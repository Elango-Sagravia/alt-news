Blackstone Credit is[ investing](https://www.privateequitywire.co.uk/blackstone-acquires-3-5bn-stake-in-eqts-midstream-natural-gas-assets/#:~:text=Blackstone%20Credit%20%26%20Insurance%20\(BXCI\),a%20report%20by%20Alternatives%20Watch.) $3.5 billion in EQT’s midstream natural gas infrastructure.

### CHART

**Super Micro's wild ride**

![](/images/super-U2Nz.webp)

Super Micro Computer Inc. has experienced a volatile year, with its stock outperforming significantly in the early months before plunging due to listing concerns and governance issues. While its gains in March marked a peak, the company struggled in the latter half of the year amid auditor resignations and delayed filings, leading to a sharp decline in share value. Despite recent recovery efforts, including the appointment of a new auditor and a compliance plan submission to Nasdaq, the uncertainty surrounding potential delisting continues to weigh on investor sentiment.

Meanwhile, competitors like Dell Technologies have seen steady performance, outpacing Super Micro's returns during its downturn. Investors remain divided on Super Micro’s outlook, with some optimistic about its recovery potential and others cautious amid ongoing regulatory and governance challenges. The contrasting performance highlights the broader implications of corporate governance and regulatory scrutiny in high-growth sectors like AI and servers.\*\*

### FOUNDATIONS

**What drives the valuation of cryptocurrencies?**

![](/images/what-drives-the-valuation-of-cryptocurrencies_-IwOT.webp)\
\
Cryptocurrency valuations are driven by a mix of market demand, technology, and speculation. Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies lack cash flows or intrinsic value, so their prices are primarily determined by supply and demand dynamics. For example, Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins creates scarcity, which can push prices higher during periods of increased demand.

Technological factors, like the underlying blockchain's utility, security, and scalability, also play a key role. Cryptocurrencies that power decentralized finance (DeFi) or smart contract platforms, such as Ethereum, derive value from their ecosystems and adoption by developers.

Market sentiment heavily influences valuations as well. Speculation, media coverage, and investor psychology can lead to sharp price swings, often detached from fundamentals. Regulatory developments and macroeconomic trends, such as inflation or central bank policies, further impact prices. For instance, Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation, driving demand during periods of monetary easing.

### WHAT IS

**Index Fund**

An index fund is a type of investment fund that tracks a specific market index, like the S&P 500. Instead of picking individual stocks, the fund buys all or a representative sample of the stocks in the index, giving you broad exposure to the market. It’s like owning a little bit of the entire market.
