### Last-Mile Delivery Startups Drive Supply Chain Tech Comeback

Supply chain tech is rebounding, with VC investments growing for two consecutive quarters. In Q2 2024, $2.4 billion was raised across 167 deals, mainly driven by the last-mile delivery segment. Startups focusing on delivery services, ultrafast delivery, and autonomous logistics attracted significant capital, including Skyports Infrastructure’s $110 million raise and Getir’s $250 million investment. Despite a challenging IPO environment, this segment continues to innovate, although overall exit activity remains subdued, with just $400 million generated across 28 transactions in 2024.

### VC Funds Show Signs of Recovery with 0.4% Q4 Gain

Venture capital funds finally turned a corner in Q4 2023, posting a modest 0.4% return—their first positive performance since 2021. This slight uptick brings hope after a tough 2023, marked by a sharp decline in global exit values to $225 billion, less than half of 2021’s peak. Anticipated Fed rate cuts could further stimulate dealmaking, potentially boosting valuations and IPO activity. However, despite the brighter outlook, a significant divide remains between well-positioned startups and those struggling to secure exits, with many settling for minimal M&A returns.

### European Leveraged Loans Hit by Recession Fears

Despite a generally positive economic backdrop, European leveraged loan markets have been hit by recent volatility, particularly in the tech, luxury, and auto sectors. Investors focus on companies struggling with AI disruption, reduced consumer confidence, and the electric vehicle transition. While specific sectors like financials and real estate have performed well, concerns over rising rates and potential recession loom large. Key names like Klarna and Transcom have seen notable drops, highlighting the sector's fragility. However, a significant uptick in defaults is not expected this year, with Moody's forecasting a slight decrease in Europe's default rate by year-end.

### SMBC Launches €450M Fund for European Private Credit

SMBC has launched a €450 million European direct lending fund to bolster its private credit offering and expand its international asset management business. The fund will provide financing solutions to private equity firms who are choosing between private credit or broadly syndicated options. The fund targets high-quality mid-market companies in Western Europe's defensive sectors alongside SMBC’s existing credit ventures, including a JV with Park Square Capital. While cautious about immediate M&A activity, SMBC is optimistic about a more substantial deal flow in 2025, focusing on refinancing and add-on deals this year.

### AI Boom Pushes Seed VCs Aside as Valuations Soar

In the current AI boom, elite founders command sky-high valuations, often sidelining smaller seed VCs. With pre-revenue startups like Ceramic and World Labs securing massive investments based on founder prestige, many early-stage VCs face a tough choice: invest heavily, accept lower ownership, or walk away. The fear of missing out (FOMO) leads to preemptive rounds with inflated valuations, leaving seed VCs competing with mega-funds. While some bets may pay off, the combination of uncertain revenue and high burn rates makes many AI investments risky.
