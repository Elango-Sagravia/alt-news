### Aussie PM Denies Asking Qantas for Perks

Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese[ denied](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/31/australia-pm-denies-asking-ex-qantas-ceo-directly-for-upgrades/) asking ex-Qantas CEO Alan Joyce for flight upgrades, as public attention grows on the perks given to politicians by the airline. Albanese’s office stated that he never contacted Joyce directly for any perks. This comes amid scrutiny over Qantas’s invitation-only Chairman’s Lounge, where many politicians have exclusive access. With inflation and high interest rates causing financial strain, the timing is tough for Albanese, whose Labor government has just fallen behind in the polls.

### Waymo Valued Over $45B After New Funding

Alphabet’s autonomous driving unit, Waymo, is now[ valued](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2024/10/31/alphabets-waymo-valued-at-more-than-45-billion-after-funding/) at over $45 billion following a recent $5.6 billion funding round. As demand for self-driving technology grows, Waymo has been expanding its robotaxi services, offering 150,000 paid trips weekly in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. A partnership with Uber aims to bring Waymo robotaxis to new markets, including Atlanta and Austin. This funding not only boosts Waymo’s expansion but also shows Alphabet’s commitment to self-driving despite industry hurdles, positioning Waymo at the forefront of the robotaxi market.

### KKR’s $20B Goal Tests Investor Interest

Private equity firm KKR is testing investor appetite as it[ targets](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/10/31/kkrs-20-billion-goal-tests-investor-appetite-for-buyout-funds/) $20 billion for its new North American buyout fund, offering early signup discounts to attract investors. In a challenging market where private equity has underperformed, KKR aims to buck the trend. It’s also eyeing potential investors in Asia and the Middle East as some U.S. pensions show lukewarm interest. If KKR’s fundraise succeeds, it could signal renewed strength for buyouts, particularly as private equity expands into new alternative assets.

The Spanish revival-style property, built in the late 1920s, offers stunning city views, a newly renovated kitchen, and multiple outdoor areas.

![Rogers' wireless infrastructure set for $7 billion minority stake from Blackstone](/images/blackstone-close-to-c7-billion-investment-deal-with-rogers--1--IyOD.webp)

Blackstone is nearing a[ $7 billion](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/10/30/blackstone-close-to-c7-billion-investment-deal-with-rogers/) deal to buy a minority stake in Rogers Communications’ wireless infrastructure. This move would help Rogers reduce debt as it looks to acquire a stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. CEO Tony Staffieri emphasized that the transaction will keep Rogers in full control of its network, calling it a “first-of-its-kind” deal in Canada. If completed, this investment could mark a new era in structured-equity transactions in Canadian telecom, showing Blackstone’s interest in infrastructure as a steady-return asset.

### Chinese Quant Hedge Funds Lose Their Edge

China’s quant hedge funds are[ facing](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/30/quant-hedge-funds-are-losing-their-edge-in-china-as-models-fail/) a tough year as stock surges driven by government stimulus disrupted their models. These funds, known for market-beating returns, lost ground when small-cap stocks fell sharply in February and again in September, trailing the 22% market jump. As models struggle to adapt to rapid policy-driven shifts, quant strategies are being questioned. While some firms are shifting toward AI-driven models, this year highlights the limits of traditional quant strategies in China’s volatile, policy-sensitive market.

### SEC Probes Freeport Over Indonesia Smelter Risks

![Freeport-McMoRan's $3.7 billion smelter in Indonesia is under SEC investigation for earthquake risk disclosures](/images/freeport-probed-by-sec-over-quake-risk-at-copper-plant--1--gwNj.webp)

The SEC is[ investigating](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/31/freeport-probed-by-sec-over-quake-risk-at-indonesia-copper-plant/) Freeport-McMoRan over earthquake risk disclosures for its $3.7 billion smelter complex in Indonesia. A former contractor alleges the complex, built on reclaimed coastal land, may not withstand a significant quake and could collapse. Freeport denies these claims, asserting the facility meets all Indonesian codes. The SEC probe may take months, but with copper demand rising, any disruption to Freeport’s operations could impact the metal’s global supply. Freeport’s shares have quadrupled in five years, making this development one to watch for investors.

### MetLife Sees Real Estate Market Improving in 2025

MetLife’s CFO John McCallion[ believes](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/10/31/commercial-real-estate-outlook-will-improve-in-2025-metlife-says/) 2025 will bring better days for commercial real estate. He cited solid economic growth, potential interest rate declines, and increased deal activity as reasons for optimism. While office spaces remain a challenge, other segments have hit their low point, according to McCallion. Though no “V-shaped” recovery is expected, MetLife’s recent profitable property sales signal a more stable outlook.

### Pfizer CEO Defends Strategy Amid Criticism

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla [defended](https://www.hedgeweek.com/pfizer-ceo-defends-strategy-amid-starboard-pressure/) the company’s recent strategy shifts against activist hedge fund Starboard Value’s criticism. Following better-than-expected Q3 profits driven by strong Paxlovid sales, Bourla highlighted recent acquisitions, including a $43 billion buy of cancer-focused Seagen, as transformative. Starboard has raised concerns over Pfizer’s drug development potential, pushing for improved shareholder returns. In response, Pfizer has pursued cost cuts and raised its revenue forecasts for Covid treatments, aiming to assure investors of its long-term growth plans in oncology and beyond.
