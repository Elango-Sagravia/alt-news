Activist hedge fund ValueAct has[ raised](https://www.hedgeweek.com/activist-hedge-fund-valueact-adds-121m-to-meta-bet/) its stake in Meta Platforms by $121 million, bringing its total holding to $1 billion.

### CHART

**The S&P 500 has consistently outperformed global peers in eight of the last ten years**

![US stocks dominated global markets recently, but Goldman Sachs forecasts slower S&P 500 growth ahead](/images/us-stock-I1Nz.jpg)

US stocks have consistently outperformed global peers in eight of the past ten years. This dominance of U.S. companies is driven by factors such as robust corporate earnings, technological innovation, and strong investor confidence in U.S. markets.

However, analysts at Goldman Sachs suggest this trend is unlikely to persist. They project the S&P 500’s annualized nominal total return to slow to just 3% over the next decade, a significant drop from the 13% annualized return of the past 10 years and below its long-term average of 11%. The shift is attributed to rising interest rates, increased competition from bonds, and changing market dynamics.

### BRIEFS

**Private Equity**

→ **Abu Dhabi’s IRH eyes Alphamin’s tin mines:** Abu Dhabi’s IRH is[ exploring](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/18/abu-dhabis-irh-explores-investing-in-alphamins-congo-tin-mines/) a stake in Alphamin, one of the world’s top tin producers in Congo. With a market cap of $1 billion, Alphamin operates the high-grade Bisie tin complex and paid $115.5 million in dividends over two years. Tin demand is projected to jump 20% by 2035 due to its use in electronics and renewables. Despite conflict in North Kivu, IRH’s interest underscores growing demand for critical minerals.

→ **Norway’s wealth fund merges assets units:** Norway’s $1.7 trillion wealth fund will[ merge](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/18/norways-wealth-fund-merges-real-assets-with-equities-unit/) its real assets and equities units into a new “Active Strategies” division starting January. This aims to streamline operations while retaining its focus on real estate investments. The fund, which returned $76.4 billion in Q3 2024, says the change won’t lead to job cuts. Led by Daniel Balthasar and Pedro Furtado Reis, the move consolidates expertise across asset classes.

**Hedge Funds**

→ **Turkish lira sinks as hedge funds exit:** The Turkish lira hit a[ record low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-18/lira-losses-deepen-as-funds-react-to-state-banks-lifting-support?embedded-checkout=true) of 34.6 per dollar as state banks eased their defense of the currency. This prompted hedge funds to unwind carry trades, intensifying the lira’s decline. Turkey’s high interest rates (50%) had previously attracted investors seeking lucrative carry returns, but recent policy shifts have spurred $2 billion in outflows. Despite losing 14.5% of its value this year, the lira has gained in real terms due to soaring inflation (49%).

→ **Activist Jana reshapes portfolio amid big moves:** Jana Partners has[ cut](https://www.hedgeweek.com/activist-jana-cuts-frontier-stake-exits-quidelortho-and-blackline/) its Frontier Communications stake by 59%, fully exited QuidelOrtho and BlackLine, and ramped up its investment in cybersecurity firm Rapid7. The hedge fund sold 5.7 million Frontier shares just before its $20 billion sale to Verizon was approved. Meanwhile, Jana increased its Rapid7 holdings by 34.2%, signaling growing interest in cybersecurity. The moves reflect Jana’s strategic pivot toward higher-growth opportunities, especially as Rapid7 becomes a potential acquisition target.

**Venture Capital**

→ **Healthcare VC firm raises $45M debut fund:** Initiate Ventures, led by Jessica Owens and Iana Dimkova, has[ launched](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/18/healthcare-vc-firm-initiate-has-a-new-45m-and-has-already-founded-five-startups-internally/) a $45 million fund targeting life sciences and health tech startups. The firm stands out by incubating startups in-house, turning ideas into companies. Initiate’s portfolio already includes ventures like Persana, a surgery concierge service, and Cornerstone AI, which automates healthcare data cleaning. The co-founders bring decades of experience, with Owens co-founding Grail, acquired for $8 billion, and Dimkova excelling in venture investing.

→ **Bain Capital closes $5.7B special situations fund:** Bain Capital has[ raised](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/bain-capital-raises-5-7b-for-latest-global-special-situations-fund) $5.7 billion for its second Global Special Situations Fund, surpassing the $3.2 billion from its first iteration. The fund focuses on capital solutions, real assets, and distressed opportunities. Recent investments include AQ Compute, Tyger Capital, and MRO Holdings. Despite a shrinking distressed debt market, Bain sees opportunities in structured finance and specialty investments.

**Others**

→ **Arcesium launches automated compliance solution:** Arcesium has[ introduced](https://www.hedgeweek.com/arcesium-unveils-new-regulatory-reporting-solution/) a Regulatory Reporting tool to simplify compliance for investment managers. Integrated with its Opterra platform, the solution automates reports using consolidated trade, position, and account data. Neil Visnapuu, VP of Regulatory Reporting, highlights its ability to auto-populate disclosures like SEC Form PF, freeing up resources and ensuring accuracy.

→ **Prosecutors seek 21 years for Hwang:** Bill Hwang, founder of Archegos Capital, faces a[ proposed](https://www.hedgeweek.com/archegos-founder-hwang-should-serve-21-years-say-us-persecutors/) 21-year sentence for market manipulation that caused $10 billion in lender losses. Prosecutors describe Hwang as “unrepentant” and highlight his prior securities fraud conviction. Using excessive borrowing and risky financial instruments, Hwang’s trades led to Archegos’ $36 billion collapse in 2021. While his defense cites age and health, the government argues for a harsh penalty to deter future fraud. If approved, this sentence will be among the longest for white-collar crime, second only to the term given to Sam Bankman-Fried earlier this year.

### FOUNDATIONS

**Why do central banks raise interest rates to combat inflation?**

![Why do central banks raise interest rates to combat inflation?](/images/why-do-central-banks-raise-interest-rates-to-combat-inflation_-I5NT.webp)

Central banks raise interest rates to combat inflation by making borrowing more expensive and saving more attractive. Higher interest rates discourage consumer and business spending, which reduces demand for goods and services. When demand falls, the upward pressure on prices can ease, helping to bring inflation under control.

Raising rates also tends to strengthen the national currency, as higher returns attract foreign investment, which can further reduce import prices. However, rate hikes can have downsides; they increase borrowing costs for individuals and businesses, potentially slowing economic growth and leading to higher unemployment.

Central banks carefully consider these effects when setting rates, aiming to strike a balance between curbing inflation and supporting economic stability. Interest rate changes are one of the primary tools in monetary policy, allowing central banks to influence the economy by managing inflation expectations and demand levels.

### WHAT IS

**Dilution**

Dilution happens when a company issues more shares of stock, reducing the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. Imagine you own a piece of a pizza with four slices, and then the company cuts it into eight slices – your slice is now smaller. Dilution reduces each shareholder’s ownership portion.
