![](/images/football-UzNj.webp)

Over a third of the clubs in Europe’s "Big Five" football leagues are now backed by private equity, venture capital, or private debt firms. As clubs grapple with financial challenges post-pandemic, these investors have increased their presence, with €4.9 billion invested in 2023, up from €66.7 million in 2018. The rise in private backing has also fueled the growth of multi-club owners (MCOs), now holding stakes in 41.7% of Big Five clubs. Despite regulatory scrutiny, mega-deals like Ares Management’s $500 million investment in Chelsea FC continue to shape the landscape of European football.

### European M&A Deal Flow Set for Autumn Revival

After a summer slowdown, European private equity M&A activity is poised for a significant autumn rebound. July saw a steep decline in private equity-sponsored loan issuance, dropping to €3 billion from June’s €15.2 billion. However, the year-to-date sponsored volume has already reached €53.3 billion, surpassing full-year figures since 2018, excluding 2021’s record. Despite the summer lull, Q2 2024 saw €11.8 billion in M&A-driven loan volume, the highest since Q4 2021. Upcoming deals, including Apollo’s £2.7 billion acquisition of Evri and Ardian’s buyout of Robot Coupe, suggest a strong autumn for European M&A.

### Private Equity Fund Performance Rebounds in 2024

Private equity fund performance turned a corner at the end of 2023, with global PE funds seeing a rise in one-year IRR to 10.5%, up from 8.5% in Q3 2023. This marks a return to double-digit profitability for unrealized investments and signals a positive trend expected to continue into 2024. The uptick is driven by a slight increase in exit activity, allowing PE managers to capitalize on top-performing investments. While still trailing behind the past decade’s figures, the recovery in fund performance offers renewed optimism for investors heading into 2024.

### Vista Equity Ends Take-Private Streak with $3B Jaggaer Acquisition

Vista Equity Partners breaks its pattern of take-private deals with the acquisition of Jaggaer, an enterprise procurement software company, reportedly for nearly $3 billion. This marks Vista's first large-cap buyout in two years, which isn’t a public-to-private transaction. The deal highlights a resurgence in enterprise SaaS buyouts, which saw 59 transactions in Q1 2024, up from 42 in Q4 2023. Vista’s move reflects growing confidence in the sector, driven by attractive valuations and anticipated interest rate cuts that would lower the cost of capital for leveraged buyouts.
