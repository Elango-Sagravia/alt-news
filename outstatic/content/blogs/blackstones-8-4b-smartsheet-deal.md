![Blackstone, Vista to Acquire Smartsheet](/images/25th-sep--blackstone-s-8.4b-smartsheet-deal--gold-bull-run-a-k5NT.webp)

Blackstone and Vista Equity Partners have [struck](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/24/blackstone-vista-reach-84-billion-deal-to-buy-smartsheet/) a deal to acquire Smartsheet Inc. for about $8.4 billion. Smartsheet’s shareholders will receive $56.50 per share, a 41% premium over its average trading price. This acquisition is part of a broader trend of private equity targeting software companies with steady cash flows. Smartsheet is used by over 80% of Fortune 500 companies to automate workflows. The buyout firms are providing a 45-day window for alternative offers, and the deal is expected to close by January 2025.

### HSBC Fund to Help PE Borrow

HSBC Asset Management has [launched](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/09/24/hsbc-am-launches-nav-financing-strategy-with-1-billion-target/) a new fund to assist private equity firms in borrowing against their portfolios through net-asset-value (NAV) financing. Expected to raise €1 billion ($1.1 billion), the fund will provide 10 to 15 loans to PE firms, focusing on financing portfolio growth. NAV loans are growing in popularity as PE firms face fewer exit opportunities. Though helpful, this financing method is attracting concern due to the high leverage involved. HSBC’s move is part of its larger alternative credit expansion, with $71.1 billion in assets under management as of June.

### Castlelake Secures $1 Billion Aircraft Deal

Alternative investment firm Castlelake LP has [secured](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/24/castlelake-clinches-1-billion-loan-to-buy-more-than-60-aircraft/) over $1 billion in financing from major lenders, including Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, to buy more than 60 aircraft. These planes are already leased by about 30 airlines globally. Aircraft leasing has grown rapidly as airlines sell old planes to raise capital, then lease them back to fill gaps. This trend has been boosted by slow new aircraft production post-pandemic. Castlelake may tap the asset-backed securities (ABS) market for further funding in 2025.

### Dubai Hedge Fund Jobs Surge to 1,000

Dubai’s hedge fund sector is [booming](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/24/hedge-funds-now-employ-more-than-1000-people-in-dubai/), with major names like Millennium Management and Balyasny Asset Management expanding operations. Hedge funds in the city now employ over 1,000 people, a small but significant number compared to North America and Europe. Dubai International Financial Centre, the region's financial hub, has seen employee numbers grow by 66% since 2019. With Dubai offering tax benefits and a favorable timezone, the city is becoming an attractive location for multistrategy hedge funds. Abu Dhabi is also emerging as a hedge fund hotspot, managing $1.5 trillion in sovereign wealth.

### Corteva's 2024 Profits Likely to Slip

Corteva Inc. is signaling [trouble](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/commodities/2024/09/24/corteva-says-argentina-woes-expected-to-dent-2024-outlook/) ahead for its 2024 profits, with challenges in Argentina's crop production due to dry weather conditions. The agriculture giant now expects its upper-end profit forecast of $3.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA to be "off the table," according to CEO Chuck Magro. Argentina’s corn planting struggles, worsened by La Niña, are a major concern. Corteva shares dipped 4% after the news, but Magro remains optimistic about the company's long-term outlook.

Multi-manager hedge funds like Millennium Management and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors are increasingly [investing](https://www.hedgeweek.com/multi-manager-hedge-funds-boost-external-allocations/#:~:text=Multi%2Dmanager%20hedge%20funds%2C%20which,to%20a%20Goldman%20Sachs%20report.) in other hedge funds through external allocations. This strategy allows funds to deploy capital and access new talent, which has become more popular in recent years. A Goldman Sachs report shows that around 70% of multi-manager funds now use external allocations, up from 50% in 2022.

### Hedge Funds Bet Big on Gold, Silver

![Hedge Funds Bet Big on Gold, Silver](/images/25th-sep--blackstone-s-8.4b-smartsheet-deal--gold-bull-run-b-ExMD.webp)

Hedge funds are making [bullish](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-make-bullish-moves-on-gold-and-silver-as-feds-easing-cycle-begins/#:~:text=Gold%20and%20silver%20are%20gaining,a%20report%20by%20Kitco%20News.) moves on gold and silver, anticipating the start of the Federal Reserve’s easing cycle. Speculative positions in gold futures rose sharply in mid-September, pushing gold prices above $2,600 an ounce, with net longs at a four-year high. Silver, too, is seeing increased interest with net long positions reaching a two-month high. While gold is seen as a safe haven during rate cuts, silver could face pressure due to its industrial use, especially if economic activity remains sluggish.

### New Hedge Fund Palinuro Capital Launches Soon

Palinuro Capital, a global macro hedge fund based in Amsterdam, is set to [launch](https://www.hedgeweek.com/new-global-macro-hedge-fund-palinuro-capital-gears-up-for-january-launch/) in January 2025 with nearly $100 million in investor commitments. The fund, led by Alfonso Peccatiello, will focus on trading futures, options, and swaps, aiming to outperform during periods of market volatility. With a strong emphasis on interest rates and currencies, it’s positioning itself as a portfolio diversifier in times of inflation and economic uncertainty.

### DTCC's AIP Service Hits Milestone

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) Alternative Investment Product (AIP) service has [reached](https://www.hedgeweek.com/dtccs-alternative-investment-product-passes-2500-clients-milestone/) 2,500 unique clients. AIP is a centralized platform that streamlines trade processing for hedge funds and funds of funds, handling post-trade reporting and money settlements. This service connects issuers and distributors in the alternative investments industry, providing greater transparency and efficiency.

### Digital Asset Funds See More Inflows

Digital asset funds are seeing [renewed](https://www.hedgeweek.com/digital-assets-funds-see-second-consecutive-week-of-inflows-2/) investor interest, with two consecutive weeks of inflows totaling $321 million. Most of the inflows went into Bitcoin, driven by the recent Federal Reserve rate cuts. Bitcoin alone saw $284 million in inflows, with short-Bitcoin products also drawing attention due to the price moves. Ethereum, on the other hand, continued to see outflows for the fifth straight week, losing $29 million. As the Fed’s easing cycle unfolds, digital assets are back on the radar for investors looking to capitalize on shifting monetary policy trends.
