### Bahrain Sells Oil Pipeline Stake

![Oil Pipeline Stake in Bahrain](/images/12th-sept--blackrock-pipeline-deal--blackstone-optimistic-on-inflation-a-c2ND.webp)

Bahrain has [sold](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/commodities/2024/09/11/bahrain-offloads-stake-in-key-saudi-oil-pipeline-to-blackrock/) a minority stake in a key oil pipeline to BlackRock. The pipeline, which moves crude oil from Saudi Arabia to Bahrain, can transport up to 350,000 barrels a day. This deal is part of Bahrain's strategy to open its energy sector to foreign investments, following similar moves by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The two companies also signed an agreement to explore new projects in areas like electric vehicles and carbon capture. For BlackRock, it’s another push into the Middle East, a region they’ve been aggressively expanding into lately.

### Blackstone Sees US Inflation at Target

Blackstone’s CFO Michael Chae is [optimistic](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/11/blackstone-finance-chief-chae-says-us-inflation-is-at-target/#:~:text=Blackstone%27s%20own%20measure%20of%20inflation,that%20began%20in%20March%202022.) that the Federal Reserve’s inflation fight won’t lead to a US recession. Speaking at a recent conference, Chae said inflation is “at target” based on Blackstone’s own data. While official inflation data shows mixed signals, Blackstone’s measure puts inflation at 1.7%. They believe wage growth will moderate, and margins are holding up across their portfolio. Chae also hinted at a potential return of deal-making “animal spirits” in 2025, signaling optimism for a stronger transaction market after a slow few years.

### Chatham Launches New CLO Business

Chatham Asset Management is [diving into](https://www.hedgeweek.com/chatham-am-launches-clo-management-business/) the CLO (Collateralized Loan Obligation) game with a new division called CTM Asset Management. This new entity will be led by industry veterans, including Thomas Flannery, who previously managed over 70 CLOs at Credit Suisse. CLOs pool loans together and sell pieces to investors, offering returns based on different risk levels. With Chatham’s strong leadership and capital commitment, CTM is set to make a splash in the leveraged credit market.

### Luxury Muni-Bonds Are Heating Up

High-end real estate developments are tapping into the muni-bond market, [leading](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/11/posh-real-estate-deals-boom-in-high-flying-junk-muni-bond-market/) to a surge in “luxury dirt deals.” These junk-rated bonds, usually financing schools and roads, are now funding projects like vacation homes and resorts. In 2024, junk-rated muni-bonds gained 7.2%, outpacing safer options and even US corporate debt. These deals are risky since they rely on future revenue, but investors are drawn to the potential high returns.

### Hedge Funds Navigate August Volatility

Hedge funds [faced](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-navigate-record-volatility-to-post-august-gains/#:~:text=Hedge%20funds%20navigated%20an%20historic,%2B0.25%25%20for%20the%20month.) a wild ride in August, but many managed to come out ahead. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index gained 0.25%, with equity hedge and fixed-income strategies leading the way. Technology and healthcare stocks helped drive those gains, while multi-manager pod shop hedge funds also had a strong month. Despite the choppy start to August, most funds turned things around by month’s end. Volatility isn’t going anywhere, though, so expect hedge funds to keep adjusting their strategies as the year continues.

### Trend-Following Funds Hit by August Volatility

Trend-following hedge funds had a rough August, [losing](https://www.hedgeweek.com/nz-dollar-and-japan-bonds-weigh-on-august-cta-returns/) big on bets in Japanese bonds, the New Zealand dollar, and other assets. SocGen data shows that some funds posted double-digit losses as crowded trades unwound in response to market volatility. However, a few shorter-term trading funds performed well, managing to profit from quick pivots in market trends. Even though some funds took a hit, many still remain positive for the year.

Standard Chartered is [launching](https://www.hedgeweek.com/standard-chartered-launches-uae-digital-asset-custody-service-with-bh-digital-as-first-client/) a digital asset custody service in the UAE, and Brevan Howard Digital is its first client. This new service will initially focus on bitcoin and ether, with plans to expand into other assets. Standard Chartered sees this as a big step in bridging traditional financial services with the emerging digital asset world. With a global reputation and a solid infrastructure, the bank hopes to attract more institutional clients looking for safe, regulated ways to store their digital assets.

### Brevan Howard Co-Founder Considers Geneva Move

Alan Howard, co-founder of hedge fund Brevan Howard, is [reportedly](https://www.hedgeweek.com/brevan-howard-co-founder-mulls-swapping-london-for-geneva/) thinking about moving back to Geneva from London. This possible relocation comes as the UK faces potential tax hikes under the new Labour government. Howard previously lived in Geneva and may be eyeing a return as the political and fiscal landscape shifts in the UK. Brevan Howard has been navigating changes itself, cutting staff and trimming fees, but it remains one of the leading players in the hedge fund world. It’s unclear if Howard’s move will happen, but it’s on the table.

### Brazilian Hedge Funds Bet on Rate Hikes

Brazil’s top hedge funds are [betting](https://www.hedgeweek.com/brazilian-hedge-fund-majors-adopt-bearish-stance-on-local-rates/#:~:text=Brazil's%20leading%20hedge%20fund%20managers,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.) on higher local interest rates amid concerns about fiscal stability. Managers like Verde Asset Management and Kapitalo Investimentos are positioning themselves for rising rates, worried about Brazil’s budget deficit, which has ballooned to 10% of GDP. The government has focused more on raising revenue than cutting spending, which could lead to tighter monetary policy. While some see an opportunity in the rate differential between Brazil and the US, many Brazilian hedge funds are staying defensive on local assets.
