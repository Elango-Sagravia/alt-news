### HEADLINES

**Two Sigma lays off 200 employees**

![Two Sigma announces 200 layoffs as part of a strategic business review under new co-CEOs](/images/two-sigma-lays-off-200-employees-A4ND.webp)

Two Sigma Investments is[ letting go](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-21/hedge-fund-two-sigma-cuts-200-staffers-after-strategic-review?embedded-checkout=true) of 200 employees—10% of its workforce—after a business review by its new co-CEOs, Carter Lyons and Scott Hoffman. The cuts affect corporate, engineering, trading, and securities teams but leave portfolio managers untouched. The founders, John Overdeck and David Siegel stepped back from day-to-day management earlier this year due to internal tensions, staying on as chairmen. The move signals Two Sigma’s aim to sharpen focus on value-driving areas.

Private equity giant Cinven has taken a[ majority stake](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/cinven-wins-grant-thorntons-uk-business-in-1-5b-deal#:~:text=Cinven%20has%20acquired%20a%20majority,\(%241.5%20billion%2Dplus\).) in Grant Thornton UK in a deal reportedly worth over $1.5 billion. The acquisition ensures Grant Thornton UK won’t merge with its US counterpart backed by New Mountain Capital. Cinven’s move reflects continued PE interest in professional services, with European investments hitting €79 billion this year. This follows recent high-profile deals like Investcorp acquiring PKF O’Connor Davies. The UK firm, with 5,500 employees across 20 offices, recently underwent leadership changes and is poised for transformation under Cinven’s ownership.

### CHART

**Increasing spending in data analytics and cybersecurity**

![Cybersecurity startup Cyera raises $300M, doubling its valuation to $3B amid AI-driven growth](/images/mckinsey-AxMz.webp)

Private equity firms are gearing up for a new surge of investments in software companies after a period of intense activity. This renewed optimism stems from increased spending by chief information officers, though growth isn't consistent across all software categories. Investments in cybersecurity and data analytics are expected to see significant growth, driven by the advancement of generative AI capabilities. Spending on human capital management and finance is expected to remain relatively flat.

### BRIEFS

**Private Equity**

→ **Bain-backed Kioxia plans $4.8B IPO:** Kioxia, Japan’s No.3 NAND flash memory maker, is[ targeting](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/11/21/bain-backed-kioxia-plans-tokyo-ipo-at-48-billion-valuation/) a mid-December IPO at a $4.8 billion valuation on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Bain Capital, its majority owner, aims to capitalize on improving chip prices after prolonged losses. The IPO fast-tracks Kioxia’s efforts to stay competitive against Samsung and Micron in the memory market. Proceeds will fund capacity expansions as Kioxia eyes recovery in global chip demand.

→ **Kingsett halts $3.5B property fund payouts:** Kingsett Capital has[ frozen payouts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-21/canada-s-kingsett-freezes-payments-on-3-5-billion-property-fund?embedded-checkout=true) from its $3.5 billion Canadian Real Estate Income Fund until December 2025, citing property market pressures. The fund, which owns premium assets like Toronto’s Scotia Plaza, faces challenges selling properties amid high interest rates and weak growth. CEO Rob Kumer emphasized the move was to preserve liquidity and prepare for future recovery. Real estate markets are grappling with a “perfect storm” of rising costs, falling values, and limited liquidity, highlighting broader challenges in commercial real estate investing.

→ **Vista sells LogicMonitor stake in $2.4B deal:** Vista Equity Partners[ sold](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/20/vista-said-to-near-logicmonitor-stake-sale-at-24-billion-value/) a minority stake in LogicMonitor, an IT performance monitoring platform, to a consortium including PSG Equity and Golub Capital, valuing the company at $2.4 billion. LogicMonitor raised $800 million in new equity to fuel global expansion, and M&A. Vista, which acquired the company for $415 million in 2018, retains control. The company’s shift from infrastructure monitoring to AI-powered hybrid observability has driven 650% growth since Vista’s investment, solidifying its position in the tech landscape.

**Hedge Funds**

→ **Hedge funds win as SEC rule tossed:** A federal judge[ struck down](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/11/21/sec-dealer-registration-rule-tossed-by-judge-in-hedge-fund-win/#:~:text=US%20District%20Judge%20Reed%20O,to%20pull%20back%20from%20trading.) SEC rules requiring certain hedge funds to register as dealers in the US Treasuries market, marking a win for the industry. Hedge funds argued the rules were overly broad and costly, potentially harming market liquidity. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who will step down in January, faced criticism for overreaching regulation. The ruling spares hedge funds from compliance burdens and is expected to shape new SEC leadership’s approach toward market participants.

→ **Hedge fund GCQ bets on Japan cloud:** GCQ Funds Management,[ boasting](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/11/21/hedge-fund-gcq-up-30-a-year-bets-on-japan-cloud-software/) a 30% annualized return since 2022, is betting big on Japan’s cloud accounting sector, particularly Money Forward Inc. The fund expects a fivefold growth in the stock as regulations drive electronic receipts. While major positions include Visa and Alphabet, GCQ emphasizes pricing power and industry dominance in its picks. CIO Doug Tynan’s long-term approach and deep research are key to the fund’s success.

→ **Bill Hwang gets 18 years for fraud:** Bill Hwang, founder of Archegos Capital, was[ sentenced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/archegos-founder-bill-hwang-sentenced-to-18-years-in-prison?embedded-checkout=true) to 18 years for fraud tied to the 2021 collapse of his $36 billion family office. Hwang misled banks to secure massive trading capacity, inflating stock values until the portfolio imploded. The scandal triggered billions in losses at major banks and contributed to Credit Suisse’s downfall. While prosecutors sought 21 years, the judge highlighted the unprecedented scale of losses, comparing the case to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraud.

**Venture Capital**

→ **Cyera raises $300M, doubles valuation:** Cybersecurity startup Cyera[ secured](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/accel-backed-cyera-raises-300m-doubling-valuation) $300 million in Series D funding, doubling its valuation to $3 billion. Backed by Accel, Sapphire Ventures, and Sequoia, the AI-driven platform analyzes and secures enterprise data flows. This round follows an April Series C, also $300 million, reflecting Cyera’s rapid growth. The company recently acquired Israeli startup Trail Security for $162 million, further bolstering its portfolio. With $760 million raised in under two years, Cyera is riding a wave of investor interest in cybersecurity.

→ **Enveda raises $130M to create new medicines:** Biotech firm Enveda[ closed](https://vcnewsdaily.com/enveda-biosciences/venture-capital-funding/lmccvvvtlh) a $130 million Series C round led by Kinnevik and FPV, bringing total funding to $360 million. Using AI, Enveda explores nature’s chemistry to discover novel medicines, cataloging previously unstudied molecules into a vast database of biodiversity. The Boulder-based company aims to accelerate drug discovery and address pressing medical needs.

**Others**

→ **Adani bet turns sour for quant fund:** Shares of Adani Enterprises dropped 23% following US bribery allegations against chairman Gautam Adani,[ triggering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-21/quant-mutual-fund-s-big-adani-bet-turns-sour-on-bribery-charges?embedded-checkout=true) a $250 million scandal. Quant Mutual Fund, which bought nearly half of a $500 million share placement in October, saw its investment lose 27% of its value. The stock’s volatility adds to Quant’s challenges, already under regulatory scrutiny for alleged front-running. Adani’s troubles are expected to weigh on investor confidence, testing the resilience of the Indian conglomerate.

### FOUNDATIONS

**How does globalization affect job markets and economic stability?**

![Globalization drives economic interdependence, creating opportunities and challenges for job markets worldwide](/images/how-does-globalization-affect-job-markets-and-economic-stability_-k3MT.webp)

Globalization has complex effects on job markets and economic stability. On one hand, globalization opens up new markets, creating job opportunities in sectors like manufacturing, technology, and services, particularly in developing countries. It allows companies to access cheaper labor and resources, lowering costs and increasing efficiency.\
\
However, globalization can lead to job losses in higher-cost economies as companies shift production to countries with cheaper labor. This can disrupt communities dependent on certain industries, leading to economic inequality and social challenges.\
\
Economically, globalization fosters interdependence, which can boost growth and innovation but also makes economies more vulnerable to global shocks, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis. For workers, globalization can mean increased competition but also broader career opportunities. Balancing the benefits and risks of globalization is essential for fostering job growth and maintaining economic stability across countries.

### FUN FRIDAYS

**Thinking Fast and Slow**

![Book cover for 'Thinking, Fast and Slow,' exploring behavioral economics and cognitive biases in decision-making](/images/thinking-fast-and-slow-c1Nj.webp)

On the surface, this Nobel laureate’s groundbreaking 2011 book is a deep dive into human psychology, exploring how we think, decide, and act. But in fact, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a cornerstone for understanding the behavioral economics that drive financial markets. Kahneman masterfully unpacks how our two thinking systems—fast, instinctive reactions and slow, deliberate reasoning—shape investment decisions, risk perception, and market behavior. It reveals how cognitive biases, like overconfidence and loss aversion, lead to irrational financial choices. Packed with insights applicable to both personal finance and institutional investing, it’s a must-read for anyone looking to navigate the unpredictable world of money.

### WHAT IS

**Net Asset Value (NAV)**

NAV represents the per-share value of a mutual fund or ETF. It’s calculated by dividing the total assets of the fund minus its liabilities by the number of shares. For example, if a mutual fund has $10 million in assets and 1 million shares, the NAV is $10 per share, showing the value of one share.
