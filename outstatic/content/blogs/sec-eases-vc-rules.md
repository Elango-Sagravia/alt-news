### SEC Eases Rules for Smaller VCs

The SEC has [raised the dollar threshold](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/27/the-sec-just-made-life-a-little-easier-for-smaller-vcs/) for a venture fund to qualify as a "qualifying venture fund" from $10 million to $12 million.

The rule, a routine inflation adjustment, comes at a time when smaller VCs face challenges in a tough fundraising environment. The update is a welcome relief for emerging funds that need more flexibility to navigate the current market.
