BlackRock and Partners Group Holding are teaming up to create a [“one-stop portfolio”](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/09/12/blackrock-partners-team-up-for-private-markets-retail-offering/) for retail investors. This new offering gives access to private equity, credit, and real assets through a single subscription, making it easier for financial advisors to help clients participate in private markets. The demand for alternative investments is growing, with private markets expanding by over $1 trillion annually. BlackRock continues to grow in this space, aiming to be a leader in private investments for both retail and institutional clients, complementing its existing $10.6 trillion in assets.

### Santander Reshuffles Key Leadership Roles

Santander is making [significant changes](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/09/12/santander-to-reshuffle-private-banking-asset-management-units/) in its private banking and asset management businesses, appointing Carlos Manzano as the new CEO of its alternative assets unit. This move comes as the bank aims to expand its focus on alternative investments like private debt and infrastructure funds. These changes reflect the bank’s strategy to organize itself by business areas rather than geography. The reshuffle is part of a broader effort under new leadership to drive growth and innovation in the wealth management division, which manages €480 billion in assets.

### Point72 to Return Billions to Investors

Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management plans to [return some of its capital](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/12/point72-plans-to-return-billions-as-big-hedge-funds-cap-assets/) to investors after a period of strong growth. This move, which could amount to billions, is part of a broader trend among large hedge funds looking to limit asset size to avoid potential challenges in navigating volatile markets. Point72, which manages $35.2 billion, gained about 10% through August 2024. Other hedge funds like Citadel and Millennium have also returned capital, signaling that the biggest players are focusing on maintaining performance by capping assets.

### Millennium to Raise $10 Billion in New Cash

Millennium Management, led by Izzy Englander, is planning to [raise $7-10 billion](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/12/millennium-to-raise-up-to-10-billion-of-more-permanent-cash/) in new capital to secure more permanent funds. This structure allows clients to pledge capital that can be drawn over time, giving Millennium liquidity when needed without holding a cash cushion that could reduce returns. The new approach resembles private equity fundraising and is designed to attract and retain investment talent. With $69 billion under management, Millennium’s new capital strategy is part of a broader effort to ensure stability and strong performance in volatile markets.

### ExodusPoint Changes Fee Structure Amid Investor Pressure

ExodusPoint, a multi-strategy hedge fund, has introduced a [new fee structure](https://www.hedgeweek.com/exoduspoint-adopts-cash-hurdle/) linking performance fees to Treasury yields. This move comes in response to investor demand for stronger performance benchmarks. The new structure includes longer lock-up periods and retroactive fees dating back to early 2024. While some see this as a response to weaker performance, the broader hedge fund sector has seen $30 billion in outflows recently, signaling a shift in investor expectations. ExodusPoint’s changes could be the first of many as hedge funds adapt to evolving market dynamics.

Short sellers are [reducing their bets](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/09/12/short-sellers-ditch-european-real-estate-stocks-as-cycle-bottoms/) against European real estate companies as interest rates are expected to fall. A UBS report shows that short interest in the sector dropped to its lowest since June 2022, reflecting growing confidence that property valuations have bottomed out. With leverage improving and rate cuts on the horizon, major firms like Land Securities Group are seeing upgrades. The European real estate sector is showing signs of recovery after a rough period caused by rate hikes aimed at controlling inflation.

### Andre Laport Leaves Vinland Capital

Laport’s decision was personal, with plans to live outside Brazil, leaving control of the hedge fund to his co-founder, James Oliveira. Despite Laport’s departure, Vinland Capital will continue its existing strategies. This exit comes at a challenging time for Brazilian hedge funds, which have faced high interest rates and a declining appetite for risk. The industry has seen significant outflows over the past year, adding pressure on hedge fund managers across the country.

The board overhaul comes after Elliott called for both leaders to step down. While the board expressed support for Jordan, Elliott insists that more changes are necessary to improve performance.
