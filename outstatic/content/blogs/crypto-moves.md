### Coatue Management's Huge Nvidia Bet

Coatue Management just made a bold move by increasing its stake in Nvidia by nearly 900% in Q2. The hedge fund now holds 13.75 million shares, making up 6.61% of its portfolio. While other funds like Citadel and DE Shaw cut their Nvidia holdings, Coatue is doubling down, with its position now valued at around $1.7 billion. Coatue isn't alone in betting big on Nvidia—Renaissance Technologies and Marshall Wace also boosted their stakes. Clearly, Coatue sees massive potential in the chipmaker, and they're not afraid to back it up with serious cash.

### **Hedge Funds Shift from Industrials to Energy**

Hedge funds are making a major move, selling off industrial stocks at the fastest pace in five years while continuing to buy energy stocks. According to a Goldman Sachs report, hedge funds are offloading companies in professional services, transportation, machinery and instead picking up shares in oil, gas, and energy equipment. This shift comes ahead of a potential U.S. interest rate cut as funds look to capitalize on sectors that might benefit from lower rates. Energy stocks have been hedge funds' top buys for four consecutive weeks.

### European Funds See Record Inflows in July

European funds had a banner month in July, pulling in €48.4 billion in net inflows, the best performance since January 2023.

Equity funds also did well, bringing in €10.1 billion, with passive strategies leading the charge. On the sustainable side, Article 8 funds saw their best month yet, while Article 9 funds continued to struggle. Overall, it's been a strong year for European funds, with inflows totaling €188.7 billion since January.

The firm's macro fund is already up 20.6% this year, so adding Manners could further boost their performance. Rokos is clearly ramping up its game, and Manners' expertise in electronic trading might just be the edge they need to stay ahead in the competitive hedge fund world.

Overall, it's a sign that passive investing is staying strong in the U.K., but there's still room for active strategies to shine.
