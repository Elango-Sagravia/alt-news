### Greenlight Outpaces S&P Despite Lagging YTD

Greenlight Capital had a[ solid](https://www.hedgeweek.com/greenlight-has-strong-start-to-q4-despite-market-lag/#:~:text=Greenlight%20Capital%20began%20the%20fourth,a%20report%20by%20Institutional%20Investor.) October, posting a 1.9% gain while the S&P 500 rose just 0.1%. Led by David Einhorn, Greenlight's year-to-date growth lags behind broader markets, with an 11% increase versus 20% for major indices. Maintaining a cautious approach, Greenlight kept a “neutral net long exposure,” aiming for stability over high returns. Their biggest investment, Green Brick Partners, faced a 17% drop in October, though it's still up 33% this year. Einhorn’s view? The stock market may be nearing peak valuations. Cautious moves might just be his hedge against an unpredictable market.

### Hedge Funds Eye Turkish Lira for Stability

Turkey’s lira[ emerged](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/06/hedge-funds-turn-to-lira-as-haven-from-trump-currency-chaos/) as a safe haven amid global currency drops on news of a potential Trump presidency. State-backed banks helped support the currency, leading hedge funds to jump in, given Turkey’s high 50% interest rate. This “carry trade” move, which involves borrowing in low-interest environments to invest in higher-yielding currencies, proved attractive as other emerging-market currencies struggled. Turkish stocks and bonds also saw gains, with the benchmark stock index rising 3.2%. Despite the dollar’s strength, the lira’s high yield kept it stable, proving attractive in uncertain times.

### China Hedge Fund Star Faces Legal Turmoil

Xiao Zhang’s Pinestone Asset Management has been in the[ spotlight](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/11/06/star-hedge-funds-surge-in-china-threatened-by-us-indictment/) for stellar returns amidst China’s market turbulence, but now faces a US indictment. Accusations claim Zhang copied trade secrets from his former employer, Arrowstreet Capital, raising questions about the hedge fund’s core strategies. With $1.4 billion in assets, Pinestone managed to sidestep China’s “Quant Quake,” a feat linked to its proprietary trading system. However, these legal issues might shake up client confidence.

### Quadrature Profits Dip After Restructuring

AI-driven Quadrature Capital[ reported](https://www.hedgeweek.com/quadrature-profits-drop-76-following-restructuring/#:~:text=AI%2Ddriven%20trading%20firm%20Quadrature,report%20by%20the%20Financial%20Times.) a steep profit drop of 76% in 2024 following a major corporate restructuring. Profits fell to £56m from £231m in 2023 as they shifted their offshore fund investments. While profits now reflect a smaller portion of total returns, Quadrature's expansion plans include new offices in Singapore and New York. Known for their market-neutral strategy, the firm also ramped up employee compensation despite fewer average payouts.

The Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) is[ planning](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/06/afc-eyes-return-to-islamic-bond-market-with-300-million-deal/) to issue a $300 million Islamic bond by the end of the year, the first since 2017. This move aligns with increasing interest from Gulf investors aiming to fund African infrastructure. Partnering with First Abu Dhabi Bank and others, AFC looks to expand relationships with Middle Eastern investors, including the Saudi Export-Import Bank. This bond also ties into AFC’s broader goal to end 2024 with $2.8 billion in debt financing. With this strategy, AFC is well-positioned to support Africa’s growth through strategic infrastructure investments backed by new global alliances.

### KKR Considering Stake Sale in JB Pharma

KKR is evaluating a[ sale](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/11/06/kkr-is-said-to-consider-selling-750-million-stake-in-jb-pharma/) of its stake in JB Pharmaceuticals, an Indian company valued at $3.5 billion, potentially reducing its holding from 54% to around 25%. The transaction, valued at $750 million, could rise to $1 billion based on demand. KKR initially acquired the stake in 2020 and has since seen the stock surge by 430%. JB Pharma, a prominent player in gastroenterology and diabetes drugs, exports to over 40 countries, including the US. The sale could attract both private equity and strategic buyers, as KKR considers future divestment opportunities in a strong market.

### Schonfeld Shines After Ending Merger Talks

Schonfeld Strategic Advisors continues to[ outperform](https://www.hedgeweek.com/schonfeld-outpaces-peers-a-year-after-ending-millennium-merger-talks/#:~:text=In%20a%20year%20marked%20by,a%20report%20by%20Business%20Insider.) after ending acquisition talks with Millennium. The hedge fund posted a 2.3% October gain, pushing its year-to-date return to 15.5%. Schonfeld’s Fundamental Equity fund also saw strong performance, with a 4% gain for the month. Multi-strategy funds like Citadel and Walleye Capital also fared well, underscoring a resilient October for hedge funds in a volatile market. With a 17 out of 18-month winning streak, Schonfeld’s strategic decision to remain independent seems to be paying off, as it’s thriving in today’s complex financial landscape.

### TASE Proposes Hedge Funds in Free Float

The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) is [proposing](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-holdings-in-tase-listed-companies-to-be-classified-as-free-float/) to include hedge fund holdings in its free float calculations, a shift aimed at aligning with international standards and enhancing market liquidity. If passed, hedge funds with stakes under 15% that don’t hold board seats could be classified as free float. Currently, funds with 5% or more are excluded from free float status. This change could improve liquidity for TASE-listed companies and attract more funds.
