### Accel Registers with SEC to Boost Secondary Market Access

Accel, one of the largest venture capital firms,[ registered](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/company-news/2024/10/25/vc-firm-accel-files-with-sec-to-tap-thriving-secondary-market/) with the SEC as an investment adviser, a move that allows it to expand secondary market investments in non-public companies at discounted valuations.

### Millennium and Athos Face Losses After China Deal Collapse

Millennium Management and Athos Capital [lost](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/10/25/millennium-among-hedge-funds-losing-money-over-failed-china-deal/) significant investments after a regulatory rejection halted China National Pharmaceutical’s buyout of China Traditional Chinese Medicine Holdings (TCM).
