### Dubai’s Hedge Fund Workforce Tops 1,000

Dubai is quickly [becoming](https://www.hedgeweek.com/difc-now-home-to-more-than-1000-hedge-fund-employees/) a hedge fund hub, with major firms like Millennium and Balyasny pushing the number of hedge fund employees past 1,000. The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has seen a 66% increase in employees since 2019. While it still lags behind financial giants in North America and Europe, Dubai’s attractive time zones, low-tax environment, and office expansions are drawing hedge fund interest. Expect more growth as firms like Schonfeld and Millennium continue hiring aggressively, cementing Dubai's role in the global hedge fund landscape.

Caroline Ellison, former Alameda Research CEO and Sam Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend has been [sentenced](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/9/25/former-ftx-executive-caroline-ellison-sentenced-to-two-years-for-fraud#:~:text=Economy%7CCrypto-,Former%20FTX%20executive%20Caroline%20Ellison%20sentenced%20to%20two%20years%20for,FTX%20founder%20Sam%20Bankman%2DFried.) to two years in prison for her part in the FTX fraud. Ellison cooperated with prosecutors, providing key testimony against Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years. Ellison’s plea deal and cooperation earned her a reduced sentence, even though she faced 110 years in prison. Judge Lewis Kaplan praised her substantial assistance but emphasized the magnitude of the crime.

### Climate Change to Cost Real Estate $500B+

A new report from GIC and S&P Global [warns](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/25/real-estate-portfolios-facing-huge-climate-hit-gic-report-says/) that climate change could hit the real estate sector with more than $500 billion in costs by 2050. They analyzed over 50,000 real estate assets in the S&P Global REIT Index and found that extreme weather events, like wildfires and storms, could add $110 billion in expenses by 2030 alone. With 90% of properties exposed to heat risk, the sector may need to invest heavily in climate adaptation.

### Lexmark Could Be Sold for $2 Billion

Lexmark’s owners are considering [selling](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/international/2024/09/25/lexmark-owners-weigh-2-billion-sale-of-printer-maker/) the printer maker in a deal valued between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. Asian private equity firm PAG, along with other stakeholders, is working with an adviser to gauge interest from potential buyers, possibly other private equity firms. The company was taken private in 2016 in a $3.6 billion deal led by China’s Ninestar Corp and PAG. Since then, Lexmark has sold off its software business, but its laser printer operations remain strong, attracting attention in the current market.

### Private Equity Turns Hands-On for Profit

Private equity giants like Blackstone and Goldman Sachs are going back to [basics](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/private-equity-calls-experts-fix-113211479.html)—actually managing their companies. With deals slowing and holding periods stretching longer, PE firms are focusing on operations to boost cash flow and profit margins. Veterans from Walmart and Honeywell are being brought in to create five- and ten-year growth strategies, looking for operational improvements instead of relying on “multiple expansion.” It’s a shift that’s being driven by rising interest rates and investors demanding results. Running companies well is no longer a “nice to have”—it’s a necessity.

New York City’s transit system is about to get a major [facelift](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/09/25/nyc-transit-system-approves-record-654-billion-capital-program/) with a $65.4 billion capital plan approved for 2025–2029. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is aiming to modernize subway signals, replace aging rail cars, and renovate power stations. Half the plan’s funding still needs to be secured, but Governor Kathy Hochul is promising to fight for the money. This upgrade is crucial for low-income riders who depend on the MTA for work and school.

The New York-based hedge fund, led by Ricky Sandler, held 4.3 million shares of Smartsheet, which it bought at an average price of $36 per share. With the deal paying shareholders $56.50 per share, Eminence will see a 60% return on its investment.

### Hedge Funds Drive Hong Kong Stock Rally

Hedge funds and long-term investors are [pouring](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-boost-hong-kong-stock-rally/) into Hong Kong stocks after China’s announcement of a broad stimulus package to revive its economy. The Hang Seng Index surged past 19,000, with hedge funds accounting for 22% of the day’s trades. Chinese and foreign hedge funds led the charge, while some long-term investors took profits. The rally is expected to continue, with Hong Kong stocks being particularly sensitive to interest rate cuts. Goldman Sachs expects more gains as positioning in the region remains light, driving further buying momentum.

### Big Hedge Funds Now Control 73% of Market

Large hedge funds, managing over $5 billion in [assets](https://www.hedgeweek.com/big-hedge-fund-industry-share-at-highest-level-in-eight-years/#:~:text=The%20bank%27s%20analysis%20reveals%20that,shrink%20by%206%25%20over%20the), now control nearly three-quarters of the entire industry, according to Bank of America. Multi-strategy firms have been leading this growth, with smaller funds seeing their market share shrink. The shift shows that investors are favoring larger firms for their stability and performance, while mid-sized hedge funds struggle to keep up. The trend is expected to continue, with investors increasing their allocations to hedge funds, despite some looking at alternatives like private equity and private credit.
