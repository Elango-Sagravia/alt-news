For the first time ever, hedge funds have gone net [bearish](https://www.hedgeweek.com/hedge-funds-net-bearish-brent-crude/) on Brent crude, holding more short than long positions. Concerns over potential oversupply in 2025, particularly from non-OPEC countries, are driving this shift. China's slowing demand and US economic concerns are adding fuel to the bearish sentiment. Hedge funds also hold a net-short position in diesel and gasoline, with algorithmic trading and heavy selling pushing oil prices to two-year lows earlier this week.

### Millennium's $10bn Long-Term Capital Target

Millennium Management is [looking](https://www.hedgeweek.com/millennium-targeting-up-to-10bn-in-long-term-capital/#:~:text=Millennium%20Management%2C%20the%20multi%2Dstrategy,to%20a%20report%20by%20Bloomberg.) to raise up to $10 billion in new capital to secure a more permanent funding structure. Instead of upfront cash, they're asking investors to pledge capital that Millennium can access over time. This setup lets the hedge fund maintain liquidity without sitting on large cash reserves, which can hurt returns. It also provides stability, preventing large withdrawals during market volatility. Millennium's strategy aims to keep attracting top talent while locking in long-term capital. Investors can gradually reduce commitments after two years.

![Investors pull back from Chinese bank debt as yuan stabilizes](/images/17th-sep--millennium-seeks-10bn--bridgewater-expands-to-nyc-b-g2OT.webp)

Foreign investors are [pulling](https://www.hedgeweek.com/popular-hedge-fund-trade-hit-as-chinas-yuan-support-weakens/) back from a once-popular strategy involving Chinese bank debt. With yuan stabilization and weakening demand in the swaps market, the returns from lending US dollars to buy short-term Chinese bonds have fallen. In August, foreign investors lent only $1bn in swaps, compared to record inflows seen earlier. Chinese state banks, previously net borrowers of dollars, have shifted to becoming lenders. As China's economy slows and geopolitical tensions rise, global investors are looking elsewhere for opportunities, while the yuan trade has become less attractive.

The building, originally constructed a century ago, has been revamped, adding two new floors.

Bridgewater also has offices in Shanghai and Singapore, further showcasing its global reach.

### South Korea Appeals Elliott Damages Ruling

South Korea is [appealing](https://www.hedgeweek.com/south-korea-appeals-british-court-ruling-in-dispute-with-activist-elliott/#:~:text=The%20South%20Korean%20government%20has,report%20by%20the%20Korea%20Times.) a British court decision that dismissed its lawsuit against US hedge fund Elliott Investment Management. The $100m dispute stems from a 2015 merger between two Samsung affiliates. The Permanent Court of Arbitration had ordered the Korean government to pay damages to Elliott, but South Korea argues the ruling misinterprets the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement. The government is determined to overturn the decision, concerned it could set a risky precedent for similar cases. The case highlights the ongoing tension between governments and global hedge funds in high-stakes legal battles.
