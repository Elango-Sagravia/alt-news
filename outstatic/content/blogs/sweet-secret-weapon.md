In the midst of World War II, as Allied forces prepared for critical operations, a familiar name in American households, Hershey’s, found itself playing an unexpected role in the war effort. Instead of ammunition or weapons, the company’s contribution came in the form of a specially designed chocolate bar that would become a vital part of the soldier's rations during some of the most intense battles of the war.

In 1937, the U.S. Army approached Hershey's with a request to create a chocolate bar capable of surviving extreme war conditions. The requirements were stringent—each bar had to weigh precisely 4 ounces, be packed with energy, withstand high temperatures, and taste just good enough to get the job done without tempting soldiers to eat it casually. The result was the D Ration Bar.

The bar, a mixture of chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk powder and oat flour, was dense and high-calorie, perfect for providing soldiers with the energy they needed during long days in combat. However, it wasn’t known for its delicious taste. The D Ration Bar had a thick, bitter taste and a tough texture. To make matters worse, it was nearly impossible to bite into, and soldiers had to slice it with a knife. But it did the job.

As the war went on, Hershey’s innovation didn’t stop. Recognizing the unique challenges posed by the extreme heat of the Pacific Theater, where temperatures regularly exceeded 100°F, Hershey introduced the Tropical Bar. This variation was designed to withstand extreme temperatures, ensuring the chocolate wouldn't melt, even under intense heat. By the end of the war, over 3 billion ration bars had been produced.

In 1942, in recognition of its efforts, Hershey’s received the Army-Navy “E” Award for Excellence. This award was given to companies that made significant contributions to the war effort, and Hershey’s was one of the few food companies honored.

While Hershey’s bars fueled soldiers on the front lines, they also left a lasting impact back home. After tasting Hershey's chocolate during the war, many soldiers continued to buy it upon returning home, boosting the company's popularity and turning it into an American household name.
