### Wellpath Faces Bankruptcy Amid Debt Woes

![Prison healthcare industry faces challenges as Wellpath Holdings files for bankruptcy due to debt and costs](/images/prison-health-care-firm-wellpath-prepares-bankruptcy-filing-IzOT.webp)

Wellpath Holdings, a major prison healthcare provider owned by H.I.G. Capital, is set to file for[ bankruptcy](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/01/prison-health-care-firm-wellpath-prepares-bankruptcy-filing/) due to high debt and labor costs. The firm defaulted on a credit facility and entered forbearance after missing payments. Moody’s marked Wellpath as defaulted, citing weak earnings. This move follows struggles seen across private equity-backed prison service firms facing debt challenges and public scrutiny. Wellpath, formed from mergers since 2018, reported $2.4 billion in revenue but was weighed down by leveraged debt. This bankruptcy highlights the risks of high-leverage strategies in industries under public and financial pressure.

![Boeing raises $23 billion to boost balance sheet and avoid credit downgrade before U.S. election](/images/boeing-bankers-raise-to-300-million-in-capital-raise-fees-gwOD.webp)

Boeing[ raised](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/01/boeing-bankers-grab-up-to-300-million-in-capital-raise-fees/) over $23 billion, paying hefty fees to lead banks like Goldman Sachs, each pocketing up to $75 million. This cash influx comes ahead of the US election as equity markets cool. The funds aim to strengthen Boeing’s balance sheet and fend off a credit rating downgrade. Despite a strong IPO market since 2021, firms are cautious. Boeing’s capital raise included a significant common share sale and convertible preferred stock. With market uncertainties looming, this move underscores the lengths companies are willing to go to secure financial stability.

### CLO Market Revitalized by Reset Wave

Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) have seen a [resurgence](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/11/01/reset-wave-injects-new-life-into-1-trillion-clo-market/), with over $172 billion in refinanced resets this year.

About 25% of CLOs are now outside reinvestment restrictions, down from 35% last year. This renewed activity supports high-yield companies and private equity deals. With loan prices inching up and older CLOs expected to exit, the market remains dynamic. For equity investors, resets mean higher potential payouts, adding a “new breath of life” to seasoned portfolios.
